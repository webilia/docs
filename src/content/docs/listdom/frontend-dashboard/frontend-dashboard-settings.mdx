After you create the dashboard, you can configure its details which are explained in this article. To configure these settings, head over to Listdom → Settings → Frontend Dashboard.

The available options on this page are:

## Pages

**Dashboard Page:** Put the frontend dashboard shortcode `[listdom-dashboard]` on the desired WordPress page (or any other allowed post type) and select that page here.

**Independent Add Listing Form:** The Listdom frontend dashboard has several menus including Dashboard, Add Listing, Log Out, and the fields added by addons. If you want to display only the Add listing form, you can activate this option here. Insert the shortcode `[listdom-add-listing]` on the desired page and select the page here.

## Dashboard Menus

In this section you can drag and drop the dashboard menus to change the order of them.

**Add Custom Menu:** You can press the "Add Custom Menu" button to add new menus with desired content to the Listdom frontend dashboard. the available options for each menu are:

- **Label:** The title of the menu.
- **Slug:** The slug of the menu used in the dashboard URL.
- **Icon:** The icon displayed with the title.
- **Content:** The content of the menu. You can insert any kind of content including 3rd party plugins and page builders' shortcodes e.g. Elemento, Divi, Woocommerce, EDD, etc.

The created menus can be rearranged by dragging and dropping. They also can be removed by hitting the trash icon.

## Guest Submission

Guest Submission option, lets the site user submit listings as a guest and not a registered user.

**Status:** When this option is disabled the frontend dashboard shows a message to the non-logged-in users and asks to log in.

While the option is enabled, The user can see the dashboard and submit a listing. Obviously, in this state, the logout menu item is not displayed since the user is not logged in. Since the listings must be reviewed by the site admins, a "To Reviewers" form will be added at the end of the "Add Listing" page. The listing submitter must fill out the form with their Email address and a message to the reviewers about the listing.

Based on the "User Registration" method, the "To Reviewers" form has 3 statuses which we will discuss further.

The listings will be in the pending status and need to be approved by the site reviewers. The reviewers can see the submitted pending listings in the Listings → All Listings.

The "To Reviewers" form will be displayed to the reviewers in the Single Listing section of the selected listing. To approve a listing, the reviewer must publish it.

**User Registration:** Determine how a new user must be registered to the site after the listing submission. The available options are:

- **Once Approved:** The user will be registered to the site once their listing is approved by the site reviewers. The "To Reviewers" form in this status includes these fields:
  - Email
  - Full Name
  - Message
- **Once Submitted:** The user will be registered to the site once they submit the listing and even before the listing is approved by the site reviewers. The "To Reviewers" form in this status includes these fields:
  - Email
  - Full Name
  - Password
  - Message
- **Disabled:** The user won't be registered on the site. The "To Reviewers" form in this status includes these fields:
  - Email
  - Message

The Email and Password fields are required wherever they exist.

## The Best User Role For Using Listdom

By installing Listdom, two new user roles called "Listdom Author" and "Listdom Publisher" will be added to the WordPress user roles. You can set these roles to be the new default user role in Setting → General → New User Default Role. Users with these roles can have access to the frontend submission without having access to the WordPress dashboard.

### What Is the Difference Between Listdom Author and Listdom Publisher Roles?

The listings of the user with the Listdom Publisher role will be published automatically but the Listsom Author listings will be in pending status unless the site admin publishes them.

## Fields

**Locations:** Choose the Locations box to be a checkbox field or a dropdown field in the Add Listing form.

**Features:** Choose the Features box to be a checkbox field or a dropdown field in the Add Listing form.

**Gallery Method:** There are two ways to upload the images as the listing gallery. The WordPress Media and the Simple Uploader. The WordPress Media mode shows up a window like the default WordPress media manager. The user can select from other images on the site or upload new ones. The Simple Uploader mode simply opens the user's device file manager to select and upload the images.

**Required Fields:** Select the required fields for the Add Listing on the frontend dashboard. The user must fill out the selected fields to be able to submit a listing. Some of the fields are permanently mandatory since they are required for a listing to work properly:

- Listing Title
- Category
- Guest Email
- Guest Password

## Restrictions

Apply some restrictions to the Add Listing form elements. The available options are:

- **Maximum Gallery Images:** Set the Maximum allowed number of images that the user can upload to a listing.
- **Maximum Image Size Allowed:** Set the maximum allowed size for the Gallery images and the featured image of the listings. Leave it empty for unlimited size of images. The size is in kilobyte
- **Maximum Description Length:** Determine the maximum number of characters allowed to be written in the listing description field.
- **Maximum Number of Tags:** Enter a number so that the number of listing allowed tags will be limited to that.

If the user enters more content than the allowed numbers, then an error message will be displayed.

## Modules

Select which items can be shown in the frontend Add Listing form. You can enable elements or options in the add listing form for all of the users that have access to the Add Listing form. Also, you can change the access level and restrict it to site admin and editor roles. The third option for each element is to disable them.

<Aside type="note">
The listing title, category, description, and claim addon cannot be disabled. Also, some add-on elements don't have a field on the Add Listing form so there is no option for them here e.g. Reviews add-on's discussion element.
