The **Listdom Stats Addon** introduces a **Stats** section to listing detail pages, allowing you to show key engagement metrics for each listing. Once enabled, the Stats section can display how many times a listing has been viewed, how many inquiries it received, and other interactions. This addon helps listing owners and site visitors gauge a listing's popularity at a glance.

## Enabling the Stats Section

After installing the Stats addon, enable the Stats section in the listing detail page options. By default, this section is disabled so it won't appear until turned on. To enable it, go to the Listdom settings for the single listing (detail page) layout. In the Listing Elements configuration, find **Stats** and toggle it on (set **Enabled** to "Yes"). You can also choose whether to show a section title (defaults to Off). If showing the title, you can customize the title text (default is "Stats") and alignment.

<Aside type="note">
The Stats section is only visible on the individual listing detail page. It will not appear on listing cards or archive pages.
</Aside>

### Stats Section Options

Once the Stats element is enabled, you have several options to configure which statistics to show and how to display them. All of these settings are accessible in the single listing page configuration when editing the Stats element.

- **If Zero**: Determine whether to display stats that have a value of zero. By default this is set to **Display**, meaning even zero counts (e.g. 0 views) will be shown. You can change it to **Hide** to omit any stat category that is currently zero.
- **Visits**: Toggle whether to show the total number of views (visits) the listing has received. (Default **Yes** - display the visit count.)
- **Contacts**: Toggle whether to show the number of contacts or inquiries sent to the listing owner. (Default **Yes** - show the contacts count, which counts uses of the listing's contact form or contact button.)
- **Offers**: Toggle display of the number of offers/bids the listing has received. (Default **Yes** - show offers count.) <Badge text="Pro" />
- **Bookings**: Toggle display of the number of bookings made for the listing. (Default **Yes** - show bookings count.) <Badge text="Pro" />
- **Reviews**: Toggle display of the number of reviews the listing has received from users. (Default **Yes** - show reviews count.) <Badge text="Pro" />
- **Comments**: Toggle display of the number of comments on the listing. (Default **Yes** - show comments count.)

<Aside type="note">
The **Offers** stat requires the Listdom Auction add-on to be installed (to track bids/offers) <Badge text="Pro" />. The **Bookings** stat only applies if the Listdom Booking add-on is active <Badge text="Pro" />. Likewise, **Reviews** will show the count from the Listdom Reviews add-on, if installed. If these addons are not present, those specific stats won't be available in the Stats section.
</Aside>

Each statistic that is toggled **On** will be displayed in the Stats section. For example, if Visits, Contacts, and Reviews are enabled, the listing detail page will show the total number of views, the count of contact inquiries, and the number of reviews for that listing. If a particular stat is disabled, it will be omitted from the section entirely.

When **If Zero** is set to **Hide**, any stat category with a zero value will not be shown on the front-end. For instance, a brand new listing with 0 contacts and 0 reviews would, in that case, show only the visits count until those other values become non-zero.

## How Listing Stats are Tracked

Once the Stats addon is activated, Listdom automatically starts tracking certain engagement metrics for each listing:

- **Visits**: Each time a listing's detail page is viewed by a user, a visit counter for that listing is incremented. This count reflects the total number of views.
- **Contacts**: If a visitor uses the listing's contact form or reveals the contact information (depending on your theme's functionality), Listdom counts that as a contact. The Stats addon will display the total number of times users have attempted to contact the listing owner.
- **Offers/Bookings/Reviews**: These counts are pulled from their respective addon data. For example, if using the Auction addon, every bid or offer on the listing will contribute to the Offers count. Bookings made via the Booking addon will increment the Bookings stat. Approved user reviews from the Reviews addon contribute to the Reviews count.
- **Comments**: This stat reflects the number of WordPress comments on the listing's detail page (if comments are enabled on listings). It will update automatically as users leave comments.

These metrics are stored with each listing and updated in real-time. The listing owner does not need to do anything special - the Stats addon works behind the scenes. Site administrators can also view these values in the back-end (for example, the **Listing Visits** and **Listing Contacts Count** may appear as custom fields or meta information for the listing in the admin area).

<Aside type="tip">
Encourage listing owners to enable the Stats section so they can monitor their listing's performance. It provides social proof to visitors (e.g., "This property has 120 views") and gives owners feedback on how their listing is doing.

## Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Monitor Listing Performance">
    A property owner enables the Stats section to track how popular their listing is. They can see it has 150 Visits and 10 Contacts, indicating strong interest from buyers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Combined with Reviews">
    Using Stats alongside the Reviews addon, a restaurant listing shows 85 Visits and 5 Reviews. New visitors can quickly gauge both the popularity and customer feedback for the restaurant.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Offers on Auction Listings">
    On a car listing that uses the Auction addon, the Stats section displays Visits, Contacts, and Offers. The seller sees 20 Offers <Badge text="Pro" /> and knows there is active bidding competition on their vehicle.
