The Labelize Addon <Badge text="Pro" /> allows you to monetize listing labels (e.g., "Featured", "Verified") by integrating with WooCommerce. You can attach a price to these labels and let listing owners purchase them for their listings.

<Aside type="caution">
The Labelize addon requires WooCommerce to be installed and activated.
</Aside>

## Settings
Go to **Listdom > Settings > Addons > Labelize**:
- **Auto Order Complete**: Toggle whether WooCommerce orders for label purchases should be automatically marked as "Completed." (Default: Yes)

## Setup for Selling Labels
<Steps>
1. **Create Listing Labels**: In **Listdom > Listings > Labels**, add the labels you plan to sell (e.g., "Featured", "Highlighted").
2. **Create WooCommerce Products**: For each label you want to sell, create a corresponding WooCommerce product and set a price.
3. **Assign Products to Labels**: Go back to **Listdom > Listings > Labels**, edit a label, and use the new field to assign its corresponding WooCommerce product.
4. **Verify Auto Complete Setting**: Ensure "Auto Order Complete" is enabled if you want orders to complete instantly.
</Steps>

## Purchasing Labels (Listing Owners)
Once set up, listing owners can purchase labels for their listings via the front-end dashboard.

- In the "Labels" section of the listing edit form, they will see available purchasable labels with their prices.
- They can select the labels they want and click **Add to Cart**.
- They are then directed to the standard WooCommerce checkout to complete the purchase.
- If "Auto Order Complete" is on, the purchased labels are automatically assigned to the listing as soon as payment is successful.

<Aside type="note">
Purchased labels remain on the listing indefinitely unless removed manually. The Labelize addon does not expire labels automatically.
</Aside>

## Examples
<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Featured Listing Upsell">
    A real estate directory sells a "Featured" label for $20. An agent purchases it for their property, and after payment, the listing automatically gets a bright "Featured" ribbon on its thumbnail, increasing its visibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verified Badge via Purchase">
    A services marketplace monetizes its "Verified" badge by charging $5. Service providers pay the fee through their dashboard. Once the order completes, the addon attaches the "Verified" label, which appears as a checkmark icon on their profile.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
