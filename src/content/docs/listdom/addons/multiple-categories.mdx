The **Multiple Categories Addon** enables you to assign more than one category to a single listing. By default, Listdom listings have a single primary category, but with this addon you can select additional categories for each listing. This is especially useful for listings that logically belong to several categories (for example, a restaurant that is both <Badge text="Vegan Friendly" /> and <Badge text="Family Friendly" />). 

<Aside type="note">
If you deactivate this addon, listings will revert to using only their primary category.

## Configuration Options

### Display Multiple Categories

**Display Multiple Categories:** *(Switch, default OFF)* – Enable this option to display all the categories assigned to a listing on the front-end, alongside the primary category. When this is turned **On**, each listing’s additional categories will be visible on listing cards and detail pages, typically as extra category labels or tags. If this is **Off**, the addon still allows multiple categories to be selected in the listing editor, but only the primary category will be shown to users.

<Aside type="tip">
Primary category functionality remains intact. The first or designated primary category may be used for features like category-specific styling or filters, even when multiple categories are enabled.

## Using the Multiple Categories Addon

<Steps>
1. **Activation:** Install and activate the *Listdom Multiple Categories* addon. Once activated, navigate to **Listdom > Settings > Addons** tab. Here you will find the **Multiple Categories** section.
2. **Enable Setting:** Turn on the <strong>Display Multiple Categories</strong> switch if you want all categories to display on listing views. Save your settings.
3. **Assign Categories to Listings:** When adding or editing a listing (in the WordPress dashboard or front-end submission form), you will now be able to select multiple categories. Use the checkboxes (or multi-select UI) to pick all relevant categories for the listing.
4. **Primary Category:** Designate a primary category if needed (this might be the first selected category by default). The primary category is used as the main reference for the listing, such as in breadcrumbs or category-specific features.
5. **View Results:** On the front-end, visit a listing that has multiple categories. If **Display Multiple Categories** is enabled, you will see all assigned categories displayed. For example, a listing might show “Category: Restaurants, Vegan” instead of just one category.
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
Listings will appear under each of the categories you assign. This means a single listing can show up in multiple category archive pages, giving it more visibility.

## Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
    **Multiple Category Labels:** A café listing is tagged under both *Coffee Shops* and *Desserts*. With this addon, the listing displays both category labels on its card, and users can find it when browsing either category.
  </Card>
  <Card>
    **Category Filter Broadening:** A real estate listing is categorized as both *For Sale* and *Luxury*. If a visitor filters by the *Luxury* category, the listing still appears, even if its primary category is *For Sale*, because the addon has assigned it to both.
  </Card>
  <Card>
    **Category-Specific Styling:** An events listing is placed in multiple categories such as *Music* and *Nightlife*. Using <Badge text="Pro" /> features, you could set a unique style for the *Music* category, and the listing will adopt that style when viewed under Music, thanks to its primary category, while still also appearing in *Nightlife* listings.
