# BuddyPress Addon

The BuddyPress Integration Addon <Badge text="Pro" /> connects Listdom with the BuddyPress social networking plugin. It creates a seamless experience where your directory's users have social profiles that showcase their listings and activities.

<Aside type="danger">
This addon requires the **BuddyPress** plugin to be installed and active for any features to work.
</Aside>

## Features Overview

- **Profile Listings Tab**: Adds a new tab in each user's BuddyPress profile named "Listings," which displays the listings authored by that user.
- **Configurable Shortcode for Profile Listings**: In settings, select a Listdom archive shortcode (e.g., a grid skin) to render the listings on the profile tab.
- **Private Message for Contact Form**: Integrates Listdom's listing contact form with BuddyPress Private Messaging. When a logged-in user fills out the form, the message is delivered as a private message to the listing owner.
- **Activity Streams Integration**: Broadcasts key Listdom events to the BuddyPress activity feed, such as new listings, new offers (requires Auction Addon), or new reviews (requires Reviews Addon).

## Settings

Go to **Listdom > Settings > Add-ons > BuddyPress** to adjust integration options.

### Profile
- **Profile Menu**: Toggle to add the "Listings" menu to BuddyPress member profiles (default: Enabled).
- **Shortcode**: Choose which Listdom shortcode (archive view) will display under the "Listings" profile tab.

### Contact
- **Private Contact Message**: Enable to route listing contact form submissions into BuddyPress private messages (default: Disabled).

### Activities
Toggle which events generate BuddyPress activity feed posts. All are off by default except New Listing.
- **New Listing**: Post an activity update when a user publishes a new listing (default: Enabled).
- **New Offer**: (Requires Auction Addon) Post an update when an offer is made on a listing (default: Disabled).
- **Offer Accepted**: (Requires Auction Addon) Post an update when an offer is accepted (default: Disabled).
- **New Review**: (Requires Reviews Addon) Post an update when a new review is submitted (default: Disabled).

## Using the BuddyPress Addon

<Steps>
1. **User Profile Listings**: When a user visits a profile, they will see a "Listings" tab showing the listings that this user has published, displayed using the shortcode you selected.
2. **Contact via Private Message**: The "Contact Owner" form on a listing will create a new private message thread in BuddyPress between the sender and the listing owner.
3. **Activity Feed**: New listings, offers, or reviews will automatically appear in the BuddyPress activity feed if enabled, increasing social interaction and visibility.
</Steps>

## Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Agent Profile Showcasing Listings">
    Sarah is a real estate agent. Visitors to her BuddyPress profile see a "Listings" tab displaying a grid of her 5 properties. A potential client can immediately see all of Sarah's offerings without running a separate search.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Social Interaction on New Listings">
    John posts a new listing. The addon creates an activity update: "John added a new listing: John's Auto Shop." John's friends see this in their news feed and comment on it, driving traffic to the new listing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Private Messaging for Inquiries">
    Maria uses the contact form on Alex's listing. Instead of waiting for an email, she finds Alex's reply in her BuddyPress messages. They chat back and forth and agree on a project, all via the site's private messaging.
