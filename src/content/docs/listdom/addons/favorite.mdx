The Favorite Addon <Badge text="Pro" /> adds wishlist-style functionality to Listdom. It lets users mark listings as "favorites" so they can easily save and revisit them. This addon provides a favorite icon/button, shortcodes to display favorited listings, and integration with user dashboards.

## Settings
Go to **Listdom > Settings > Addons > Favorites** to configure options:

- **Status**: Enable or disable the Favorites feature (enabled by default).
- **Access**: Determine who can save favorites. Options are `Guest Users` (default) or `Only Loggedin Users`.
- **Shortcodes**: Use `[listdom-favorites]` to display a user's favorite listings and `[listdom-favorites-count]` to show the number of favorites.
- **Show in Dashboard**: Toggle whether a "Favorites" section appears in the user's front-end dashboard (enabled by default).
- **Target Shortcode**: If "Show in Dashboard" is on, select a listing archive shortcode to control the layout of the favorites list in the dashboard.

<Aside type="note">
If **Access** is set to `Only Loggedin Users`, visitors will be prompted to log in. If set to `Guest Users`, favorites for non-logged-in users are tracked via browser cookies or IP.

## Using the Favorite Addon
When active, every listing will display a favorite icon (usually a heart).

- **Adding a Favorite**: Clicking the icon saves the listing to the user's favorites, and the icon's style changes to indicate it's favorited.
- **Removing a Favorite**: Clicking the icon again removes the listing from favorites.

Users can view their saved favorites in two main ways:
1.  **Favorites Dashboard Tab**: In their front-end dashboard, a "Favorites" tab will list all saved items.
2.  **Favorites Shortcode Page**: You can create a dedicated page (e.g., "My Favorites") and insert the `[listdom-favorites]` shortcode to display the user's saved listings.

<Aside type="tip">
Consider placing a Favorites count in your menu or header. For example, add an icon with `[listdom-favorites-count]` next to it, so users can always see how many listings they've saved.

## Examples
<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Personal Wishlist">
    A user browsing a real estate site clicks the heart on multiple properties. Later, they visit their Favorites page to review all saved properties in one place, making it easier to track interesting listings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Favorites Counter in Header">
    A directory site adds a heart icon in the navigation bar showing "Favorites (3)" using the count shortcode. This gives users a constant, visible update on their saved items and improves engagement.
