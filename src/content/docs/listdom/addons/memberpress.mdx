The MemberPress Addon <Badge text="Pro"/> connects Listdom with the MemberPress membership platform. This integration lets you tailor listing submission features and enhance listing visibility based on a user's membership level.

<Aside type="note">
**MemberPress** must be installed and active for this addon to function. Once set up, the Listdom integration options will appear on your MemberPress membership configuration pages.
</Aside>

## Membership Plan Settings in MemberPress
After activating the addon, edit a membership plan in **MemberPress â†’ Memberships**. You will find a new **Listdom** tab with two sets of options.

### Submission Modules
Control which listing features or fields a user can access when submitting a listing. You can enable or disable modules per membership plan. Modules include:
- Contact Details
- Gallery
- Custom Fields
- Address / Map
- Price Options <Badge text="Pro"/>
- Work Hours <Badge text="Pro"/>
- And more...

<Aside type="tip">
Create tiered offerings. For instance, disable the `Gallery` and `Embed Codes` for a basic plan, while enabling all modules for a premium plan to add value to an upgrade.
</Aside>

### Listing Rank
Assign a numeric rank value to each membership plan. This works as a boost to the visibility of listings created by members of this plan. For example, you might set **Listing Rank = 10** for a "Platinum" membership. Listings from Platinum members will receive an extra 10 points in rank, helping them appear higher in search results.

<Aside type="note">
The **Listing Rank** value only takes effect if you have a ranking mechanism enabled in Listdom, such as the **Listdom Rank Add-on**.
</Aside>

## Effect on User Experience
- **Frontend Submission**: A user will only see the fields and options that are allowed for their membership level when adding or editing a listing.
- **Listing Visibility**: If the Listdom Rank system is in use, listings from users with a higher membership rank will appear more prominently.
- **No Content Restriction**: This addon focuses on submission capabilities, not viewing permissions. All users can see all listings by default.

## Examples
<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Basic vs. Premium Plan Features">
    A directory offers "Basic" and "Premium" plans. The Basic plan allows only essential modules like Title and Contact. The Premium plan gets everything, including Gallery and Video Embeds, providing a clear incentive to upgrade.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Boosting Premium Member Listings">
    An admin assigns a rank of 5 to the "Premium" membership and 0 to the "Basic" one. As a result, listings from Premium members tend to appear higher in search results, giving them more visibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Creating a Mid-Tier Plan">
    An admin introduces a "Pro" plan between Basic and Premium. Pro members can have a gallery and map but no video embeds. They also get a small rank boost of 2, creating a tiered value structure.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
