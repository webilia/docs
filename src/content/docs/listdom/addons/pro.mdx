The **Listdom Pro Addon** is the premium extension for Listdom that introduces a wide range of advanced features. With Listdom Pro, you can allow users to submit and manage listings from the front-end, customize how listings are displayed, and take advantage of powerful new tools for search, mapping, and data management. This addon is essential for creating a professional and feature-rich directory.

## Key Features

Listdom Pro enhances nearly every aspect of the core plugin. Below is a breakdown of the major features it unlocks.

### Frontend Dashboard and Submissions

Pro supercharges the front-end user experience with advanced submission and management tools.

- **Independent Add Listing Form**: Use the `[listdom-add-listing]` shortcode to place a dedicated submission form on any page, separate from the main user dashboard.
- **Custom Dashboard Menus**: Add new custom menus to the user dashboard. You can include any content, such as shortcodes from third-party plugins, and reorder all menu items via drag-and-drop.
- **Guest Submissions**: Allow visitors to submit listings without creating an account. You can configure how guest accounts are handled:
    - **Once Approved**: A user account is created for the guest only after an admin approves their listing.
    - **Once Submitted**: An account is created for the guest immediately upon submission.
    - **Disabled**: No user account is created for the guest submitter.

<Aside type="caution">
Enabling guest submissions can increase spam. It's recommended to require admin approval for new listings or use a reCAPTCHA integration.

### Enhanced Display and Layouts

Gain granular control over the appearance of your listings with new skins, display options, and embed features.

- **New Archive Skins**:
    - **Side-by-Side Skin**: A practical layout for showing listing details next to each other.
    - **Mosaic Skin**: A modern, visually appealing mosaic grid for your listings.
    - **Accordion Skin**: A responsive accordion layout to display listings compactly.
- **Display Options Per Listing**: Admins or listing owners can override the global design for individual listings, choosing a specific style or toggling elements (like the map or gallery) on or off.
- **Display Options Per Category**: Assign a unique single listing style to each listing category, giving different sections of your directory a distinct look and feel.
- **Advanced Listing Links**: Control what happens when a user clicks a listing in an archive view:
    - **Lightbox**: Open the listing details in a pop-up lightbox.
    - **Side Panels**: Open details in a panel sliding from the right, left, or bottom without reloading the page.
    - **New Window**: Open the listing detail page in a new browser tab.
- **Embed and Video Features**:
    - **Embed Elements**: Embed external content like iframes or widgets directly into listings.
    - **Featured Video**: Assign a featured video to a listing, which can be displayed prominently on its detail page.

### Advanced Search and Filtering

Pro adds powerful tools to the Search & Filter Builder, allowing for more precise and user-friendly searches.

- **Hierarchical Dropdowns**: For taxonomies like Categories or Locations, display filters as chained dropdowns. Selecting a parent term (e.g., a state) will populate a second dropdown with its children (e.g., cities).
- **Radius Search**: Add a radius search to the address field, allowing users to find listings within a certain distance of a location.
- **Range Slider**: Use a range slider for numeric fields in search forms, perfect for filtering by price or other numerical attributes.
- **Search by Custom Fields**: Allow users to filter listings based on the values of your custom fields (attributes).

### Advanced Mapping Features

Upgrade your directory's maps with powerful new tools and providers.

- **OpenStreetMap & Mapbox**: Display maps using OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.js (a 100% free alternative to Google Maps) and enhance them with custom Mapbox tiles.
- **Map Draw Tools**: Allow users to draw a shape (e.g., a circle or polygon) on a map to see only the listings within that specific area.
- **Map GPS Search**: A "Your Location" button allows users to find listings available around their current GPS location.
- **Advanced Map Search**: When a user drags or zooms the map, the displayed listing results automatically update to match the new map viewport.

### Advanced Data and Integration

Pro provides developer-focused features for data management and integration with other services.

- **Hierarchical Directory URL Structure**: Enable "Advanced Slug" mode to include taxonomy terms (like categories or locations) in your listing URLs for better SEO and structure.
- **JSON Importer/Exporter**: Import and export listings using JSON files.
- **Schema Options**: Define Schema properties for your taxonomies (Features, Attributes, Categories) to improve how search engines understand your content.
- **API Support**: A comprehensive REST API allows you to integrate Listdom with third-party applications, enabling you to manage listings, users, and more programmatically.

## Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Customized Look per Category">
    A multi-category directory uses Pro to make *Hotel* listings use a gallery-centric layout, while *Restaurant* listings automatically show a reservation form. This is achieved by setting different display styles for each category.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Seamless Guest Posting">
    A visitor posts a new listing without an account. Because guest submissions are enabled, the system automatically creates a new user for them upon submission. The process is smooth and happens entirely on the front-end.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Radius and Feature Search">
    A user on a real estate site searches for a "3 Bedroom" house with a "Pool" within a "5-mile radius" of a specific address. Thanks to the advanced search features, the site returns only the listings that match all of these specific criteria.
