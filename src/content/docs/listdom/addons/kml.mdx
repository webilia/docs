The KML Addon <Badge text="Pro" /> allows you to add custom map layers to your Listdom maps using KML or GPX files. These file formats can define boundaries, shapes, routes, or points of interest on a map.

## Settings
Go to **Listdom > Settings > Addons > KML** to find the setting:
- **Display in Single Listing**: If enabled (default), KML/GPX layers will be displayed on individual listing pages' maps.

## Creating Map Layers
<Steps>
1. Go to **Listdom > Map Layers** in your WordPress dashboard.
2. Click **Add New Layer** and give it a title.
3. **Upload a File**: Choose your `.kml` or `.gpx` file.
4. **Select Type**: Choose the file type, either `KML` or `GPX`.
5. **Optional - Feed URL**: If your file is hosted remotely, paste the URL in the `Feed` field.
6. **Click Publish** to save the layer.
</Steps>

## Adding Layers to Listing Maps
You can display your created layers on Listdom maps:
- **Listing Archive Maps**: In the Listdom shortcode generator, you'll find a **KML Layers** field where you can pick one or more layers to overlay on that map.
- **Single Listing Page Map**: If "Display in Single Listing" is enabled, the map on each listing's page will show all available KML/GPX layers by default.

<Aside type="caution">
Using many or very complex KML layers can impact map performance. It's best to include only the layers you need for a given view.

## Examples
<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Service Area Overlay">
    A home services directory uploads a KML file for each company, outlining their service region. On the map, a translucent polygon shows the boundary of a company's service area, helping users find businesses that cover their location.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trail Maps on Listings">
    An outdoor activities site lists hiking trails. Using a GPX file for each trail, the admin creates layers that trace the exact path. On a trail's listing page, the map displays the GPX route overlaying the terrain for hikers to follow.
