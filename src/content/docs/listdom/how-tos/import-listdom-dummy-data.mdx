## Introduction

Creating an engaging and well-organized listing website can be challenging. You want your site to look great and function smoothly from the start. This is where Listdom's **Dummy Data Import** feature can help you. It makes setting up your site easier and faster. Let's explore what this feature is and why it's beneficial.

Listdom provides dummy data that can be imported into your site. By doing that, you won't need to start from scratch and can edit the imported items to create your directory website.

## What is Dummy Data?

Dummy data is sample data that looks like real content. It includes example listings, categories, shortcodes, search forms, etc. It helps you see what your site will look like once it's filled with real data.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Listdom → Import/Export → Dummy Data tab**.  
2. Click on the **Import Dummy Data** button.  
3. Wait for the data to be imported into your site.  
</Steps>

After import, you will get:  
- A shortcode for each Listdom skin (with a search form if available).  
- Pages containing shortcodes named **"All listing in SKIN NAME"**.  
- A frontend dashboard page.  
- A default search form.  
- Sample categories.  
- Sample locations.  
- Sample tags.  
- Sample features.  
- Sample labels.  
- Sample attributes.  

<Aside type="note">
Clicking on "Import Dummy Data" multiple times won't add new items unless any of them has been trashed.
