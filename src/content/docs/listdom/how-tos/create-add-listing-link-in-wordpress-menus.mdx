## Step By Step Guide

If you want a direct menu or link to the "Add Listing" form of the frontend dashboard, you first need to copy the correct link. To do that, go to the **Listdom frontend dashboard page** you've created and click the **Add Listing** link on the left menu. Then you need to copy the page URL.  

<Aside type="note">
If the Listdom Subscription Add-on is installed, you'll be redirected to the subscription menu. In this case, copy the URL of that page instead.
</Aside>

Finally, in the WordPress dashboard, head over to **Appearance â†’ Menus** and use a **Custom Link** with the URL you copied to create a menu item pointing to the Add Listing page.  

You can then display this menu in your site header based on the theme that you are using.
