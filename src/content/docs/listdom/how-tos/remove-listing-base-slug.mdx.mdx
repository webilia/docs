If you're using Listdom to manage your directory listings, you might have noticed that the URLs of your listings include a base slug, such as MyWebsite.com/listings/listing-name. While this structure is useful for organizing content, some users prefer cleaner URLs without the base slug. For instance, changing the URL to MyWebsite.com/listing-name can be beneficial for SEO and provide a cleaner look.

In this guide, we'll show you how to remove the listing base slug using a third-party plugin called "Remove CPT base," which is available for free on the WordPress repository.

## Why Remove the Listing Base Slug?

There are several benefits to removing the listing base slug from your URLs:

- **SEO Advantages:** Cleaner URLs are generally better for search engine optimization (SEO). They are easier for search engines to read and understand.  
- **User Experience:** Shorter, cleaner URLs are more user-friendly and easier to share.  
- **Professional Appearance:** A streamlined URL looks more professional and trustworthy to visitors.  

## Important Notes

Backup Your Site: Before making any changes to your URL structure, it's always a good idea to back up your site. This will prevent any data loss if something goes wrong.

- **SEO Considerations:** If you have already indexed URLs with the base slug in search engines, removing the slug will change the URLs, potentially affecting your SEO. Consider using 301 redirects to ensure that the old URLs redirect to the new ones, preserving your SEO rankings.
