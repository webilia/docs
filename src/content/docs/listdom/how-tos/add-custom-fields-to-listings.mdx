## Introduction
Adding custom fields to your listings in Listdom enables you to provide a richer, more tailored experience for your audience. Custom fields allow you to include unique details relevant to your niche, whether it’s rental properties, restaurant menus, or service offerings. This guide walks you through two powerful methods for adding custom fields in Listdom: **Listdom Attributes** and **ACF Plugin paired with the Listdom ACF Addon**.

Explore the step-by-step processes for both methods, the advantages and considerations of each, and how these custom fields enhance your listings.

## What is a Custom Field in Listings?
A custom field is an additional input you can add to a listing, going beyond default fields such as title, location, and price. Custom fields allow you to include extra information specific to the type of listing, like “Amenities,” “Room Type,” or “Parking Capacity.” This personalization is essential for listings that require additional detail, making it easier for users to find exactly what they need.

## Available Ways to Add Custom Fields

### 1. Listdom Attributes

**What are Listdom Attributes?**  
Listdom Attributes are built-in options that allow you to add extra data fields without needing third-party plugins. These fields are seamlessly integrated with Listdom’s interface, ensuring fast performance and easy setup.

**Why Choose Listdom Attributes?**  
- No External Plugins Required: They’re built into Listdom, reducing the need for external dependencies.  
- Streamlined for Common Fields: Attributes are optimized for general usage, making them perfect for fields like “Text fields,” or “Numeric fields.“  
- Efficient and Performance-Optimized: Attributes are native to Listdom, which means faster loading times and a smooth user experience.  

For more on setting up attributes, check out the **Listings attribute settings**.

**Setting Up Custom Fields with Attributes**

<Steps>
1. Access the Attributes Section: Navigate to your Listdom dashboard, go to **Listings → Attributes**.  
2. Add New Attributes: Enter a name (e.g., “Operating Hours”), choose an input type (text, dropdown, etc.), and assign it to relevant categories.  
3. Save and Apply: Save the attribute, and it will automatically appear in the listing submission form.  
</Steps>

### 2. Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Plugin + Listdom ACF Addon

**What is the ACF Plugin?**  
The Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Plugin allows you to create advanced, highly customizable fields for WordPress posts and pages, making it an excellent choice for users who need flexibility and extensive options for field types. The Listdom ACF Addon integrates ACF custom fields into your Listdom listings.

**Why Use ACF for Custom Fields?**  
- Wide Variety of Field Types: ACF offers a broader range of fields than Listdom Attributes, such as image fields, and relationship fields.  
- Ideal for Advanced Customization Needs: For businesses needing fields like “Image Gallery,” “Client Testimonials,” or complex data like product compatibility, ACF is an ideal solution.  

**Setting Up Custom Fields with ACF and Listdom ACF Addon**

<Steps>
1. Install ACF and the Listdom ACF Addon: Download and activate both plugins.  
2. Create Custom Fields in ACF:  
   - Go to **ACF → Field Groups** in WordPress.  
   - Add a field group, give it a name, and add desired fields (e.g., checkbox, dropdown, gallery).  
3. Connect ACF Fields with Listdom: Go to **Location Rules** of the field group and link your new ACF fields with Listdom listings.  
</Steps>

For installation instructions, see [How to Install the Listdom Plugin and Add-ons](/listdom/installation-and-activation/how-to-install-the-listdom-plugin-and-add-ons/) and the **Listdom ACF Addon Documentation**.

## Where Custom Fields Appear in Listings

1. **Single Listing Page**  
Custom fields enhance listing pages by providing users with additional, relevant information.  

2. **Elementor and Divi Widgets**  
If you’re using Elementor or Divi page builders, Listdom allows you to display custom fields within widgets. See the **Elementor Addon Documentation** and **Divi Addon Documentation**.  

3. **Search and Filter Forms**  
Custom fields can be integrated into Listdom’s search and filter forms, enabling filtering by amenities, ratings, or custom tags. Refer to [How to Create a Search and Filter Form](/listdom/search-filtering/) for guidance.

## Additional Tips for Effective Use of Custom Fields
- **Plan Your Fields Carefully:** Choose fields that add meaningful details without overcrowding.  
- **Optimize Field Placement:** Place critical fields higher on the single listing page.  
- **Use Conditional Logic in ACF:** Show fields only when specific conditions are met.  
- **Leverage Custom Styling:** Add CSS to style custom fields. See **Custom Styles settings**.
