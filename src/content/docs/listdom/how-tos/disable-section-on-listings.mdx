Listdom Listings have several sections to show the details of them. Some sections exist by default and some of them are added by Listdom add-ons. It's possible to manage these sections both on the Add Listing form of the Frontend Dashboard and the final listing details page. The settings can be applied either across the listings or for a specific one.

## Disable a section for all of the listings
To disable a section on all of the listings' final detail pages, go to **Listdom → Settings → Single listing (Details Page)**, and under the **Elements** section find that section name. Click on the check icon ✓ to disable that section on all of the listings.  

<Aside type="note">
The section will remain on the Add / Edit listing page but won't be displayed on the front end.

## Disable a section for a category
Using the Listdom Pro add-on, you can change the elements' visibility of listings in a particular category. To do that, go to **Listings → Categories**. From the **Listing Details Page Setting** section, you can change the elements' visibility. Learn more.

## Disable for a specific listing
Using the Listdom Pro add-on, you can disable the element for each listing individually. To do that navigate to the **Display Options** section on the Add / Edit listing page of the desired listing and disable each element you want.

## Disable it on the Frontend Dashboard
To disable a field on the Add listing form of the Frontend dashboard, navigate to **Listdom → Settings → Frontend Dashboard** tab and disable that element.

<Aside type="note">
The Category style options, listing Display options, and the Frontend Dashboard are available in the Listdom Pro Add-on.
</Aside>

## Disable it for a specific package
If you are using the Listdom Subscription addon, you can disable specific listing elements for a particular package. To do this, go to the settings of each package on the **Listdom → Packages** and choose the elements to enable or disable. Learn more.

<Aside type="note">
The Packages options are available in the Listdom Subscriptions Add-on.
