Creating an interactive map that dynamically updates based on search criteria can greatly enhance user experience on your classified or directory website. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up using Listdom:

## Step 1: Create a Single Map Shortcode

Start by creating a Single Map shortcode in Listdom. This shortcode will display a map on your website that can be customized to show different listings based on user interactions.

**How to Create a Map Shortcode?**
Follow the instructions on creating a Single Map shortcode. This step involves setting up the map's appearance, the default location, and the type of listings that will be displayed.

## Step 2: Associate a Search Form with the Map

Next, you need to associate a search form with the map. This allows users to filter listings based on their search criteria, which will then be dynamically updated on the map.

**Setting Up a Search Form**  
Create a search form that users can interact with. Instructions on how to create a search form are available in the [Search and Filter Builder guide](/listdom/search-filtering/). Customize the form fields according to the criteria that are relevant to your listings, such as location, category, price range, etc.

## Step 3: Implement AJAX or On-the-Fly Search with Listdom APS Add-on

To make the map interactive and responsive, you'll need to implement AJAX or on-the-fly search functionality using the Listdom APS (Advanced Product Search) Add-on. This feature ensures that listings on the map update automatically as users refine their search criteria.

**Using Listdom APS Add-on**  
Install and configure the Listdom APS Add-on, which adds the capability for real-time search updates without requiring a page reload. This is crucial for providing a seamless user experience, as the map will refresh listings based on the search parameters entered by the user.
