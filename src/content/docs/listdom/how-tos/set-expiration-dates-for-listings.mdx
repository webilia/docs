Managing expiration dates for listings in Listdom can be done effectively using two methods. Here's a guide to help you set them up:

## Method 1: Using the Built-in Expiration Feature
Listdom includes a built-in option that allows you to specify when a listing should expire and be hidden from the front end.

<Steps>
1. **Set Expiration Date**  
   When creating or editing a listing, you'll find a field for setting the expiration date.  

2. **Enter the Desired Date**  
   Once this date is reached, the listing will no longer be visible on the front end.  
</Steps>

For more detailed instructions, check out the Visibility feature documentation.

## Method 2: Using the Subscription Add-on
The Subscription Add-on lets you assign expiration dates through subscription packages, which can be applied to specific listings or categories. Here's how it works:

<Steps>
1. **Install and Activate the Add-on**  
   - Download and install the Listdom Subscription Add-on.  
   - Activate it in the WordPress dashboard.  

2. **Configure Packages**  
   - Navigate to the **Packages** settings in Listdom.  
   - Create or edit a package and set the expiration duration.  
   - Assign this package as the website default package.  
</Steps>

For more details, see the Subscription Add-on documentation.

If you need only an expiry date for the listings, then the built-in expiration option (Visibility) is the best and simplest option. By using either the built-in feature or the Subscription Add-on, you can easily manage listing expirations in Listdom. Choose the method that best suits your needs and streamline your listing management process effectively.
