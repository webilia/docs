## Introduction

Listdom's **Subscription Addon** allows you to monetize your directory website by offering different listing packages. However, in some cases, you may want to allow users to submit listings for free without requiring them to go through the checkout process.  

This can be useful for building initial engagement, attracting more users, or offering a base-level package with premium upgrades available.  
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a free package and assigning it to all existing and future users automatically.

## Step 1: Creating a Free Package

To ensure that all users can publish listings without going through the checkout process, you first need to create a free package.

<Steps>
1. **Access Packages in Listdom**  
   - In your WordPress dashboard, navigate to **Listdom > Packages**.  
   - Click on **Add New Package** to create a new subscription plan.  
   - For more details, see the [Listdom Packages Documentation](/listdom/addons/subscriptions/).  

2. **Configure the Free Package**  
   - Enter a name for the package (e.g., "Free Listing Package").  
   - Define the number of listings users can submit under this package. You may allow unlimited listings or set a reasonable limit.  

3. **Assign a Free WooCommerce Product**  
   - Listdom integrates with WooCommerce, so you need to associate the package with a WooCommerce product.  
   - Create a new WooCommerce product with a price of **$0**.  
   - Go back to the Listdom package settings and assign this free WooCommerce product to the package.  
   - Save the package.  
</Steps>

## Step 2: Subscribing All Users to the Free Package

Once the free package is created, you need to assign it to all existing users so they can start using it immediately.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Listdom > Packages**.  
2. Select the package you created ("Free Listing Package").  
3. Find the **Mass Subscription** section.  
4. Click on **Subscribe All Users** to assign this package to every existing user on your website.  
</Steps>

By doing this, all current users will be able to submit listings under the free package without needing to manually subscribe or go through checkout.
</Aside>

## Step 3: Set the Free Package as the Default Subscription

To ensure that all future users automatically receive the free package upon registration, you need to set it as the default package.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Listdom > Settings**.  
2. Click on the **Addons** tab.  
3. Locate the **Subscription Addon** settings.  
4. Find the **Default Subscription** option.  
5. Select the **Free Listing Package** from the dropdown.  
6. Save the settings.  
</Steps>

## Additional Considerations

### Customizing Free Package Features
If you want to encourage users to upgrade to a paid plan, consider limiting the free package's features. For example:  

- Restrict the number of listings a user can create.  
- Limit access to premium features like video uploads.  

### Monitoring User Engagement
After implementing the free package, monitor how users interact with it:  

- How many users are actively using the free package.  
- Whether users are reaching its limits (indicating demand for upgrades).  
- The overall impact on site activity and listing volume.  

### Encouraging Upgrades to Paid Packages
Once users get accustomed to your directory, you can promote premium packages by offering extra features such as:  

- More listings per package.  
- Featured placements.  
- Access to exclusive listing categories.  
- Priority support and enhanced visibility.
