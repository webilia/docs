The single listing page — also known as the detail page — is one of the most important parts of your directory site. It's where visitors view the full details of a listing, such as the description, images, contact information, map, and custom fields. In Listdom, you have multiple ways to control the design and layout of this page to match your brand and content style.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to fully customize the single listing page, using Listdom's built-in settings as well as visual page builders like Elementor and Divi. We'll also cover how to apply different layouts per listing, per category, or even based on membership level.

## Basic Method: Using Listdom's Default Layout System

The easiest way to control the appearance of single listing pages is through Listdom's built-in layout settings.

To access this, go to:

**WP Admin → Listdom → Settings → Single Listing**

Here, you'll find several configuration options under the **General** and **Elements** sections.

- **Style Category** lets you choose whether to use a default Listdom layout or a custom Elementor layout (if the relevant addon is installed).  
- **Style** lets you pick from pre-designed templates such as Basic, Sidebar, Slider, or User Directory.  
- **Theme Layout** allows you to choose between different page wrappers (e.g., Full Width, No Header).  
- **Element Visibility Controls** in the Elements section let you show or hide components like the map, gallery, tags, videos, and more — on a global level.  

This setup is ideal if you're looking for a quick, consistent design across your site.

## Building a Custom Single Listing Page with Elementor

If you want total control over your design, Listdom offers an Elementor Addon that lets you build single listing templates visually.

### Step 1: Install the Elementor Addon

<Steps>
1. Make sure the Elementor Addon is installed and activated.  
2. You can confirm this by visiting: **WP Admin → Listdom → Settings → Addons**.  
3. You should see "Elementor Addon" listed.  
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create a Custom Elementor Layout

<Steps>
1. Go to **WP Admin → Listdom → Elementor Styles → Add New**.  
2. Enter a name for your layout (e.g., "Modern Detail Page").  
3. Select the **Style Type** as "Single Listing."  
4. Click **Edit with Elementor**.  
</Steps>

This opens the Elementor editor, where you can build the single listing page from scratch using Listdom's custom widgets.

### Step 3: Design the Page Using Widgets

Within Elementor, you'll find Listdom widgets specifically made for single listings. For example, you can add and arrange:

- **Listing Title**  
- **Gallery and Featured Image**  
- **Map Location**  
- **Description**  
- **Contact Form**  
- **Custom Fields**  
- **Reviews**  

Use Elementor's visual tools to style each section — set fonts, colors, spacing, and responsive settings.

### Step 4: Assign the Layout Sitewide

<Steps>
1. Once your custom layout is ready, go back to: **Listdom → Settings → Single Listing**.  
2. Set **Style Category** to "Elementor."  
3. Set **Style** to the layout you just created.  
4. Save the settings.  
</Steps>

Now all single listing pages will use your custom Elementor design.

## Creating a Custom Template with Divi Builder

If you're using the Divi theme, Listdom's Divi Addon allows you to build listing detail pages using Divi's Theme Builder.

### Step 1: Enable the Divi Addon

<Steps>
1. Check that the Divi Addon is activated in: **WP Admin → Listdom → Settings → Addons**.  
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create a New Template in Divi Theme Builder

<Steps>
1. Go to **Divi → Theme Builder → Add New Template**.  
2. In the popup, choose the "Listing" post type so it applies only to single listings.  
3. Click **Create Template**, then **Add Custom Body → Build Custom Body**.  
</Steps>

### Step 3: Design the Layout with Divi Modules

In the builder, use Divi's dynamic modules and Listdom shortcodes (if needed) to add the listing details. For example, you can add and arrange:

- **Post Title**  
- **Image Gallery**  
- **Description**  
- **Map**  
- **Contact Info**  
- **Custom Fields**  

Customize the layout as needed using Divi's visual design tools.

### Step 4: Assign and Save

Make sure the template is assigned to the "Listing" post type. Then save the layout.  

Your single listing pages are now powered by Divi!

## Advanced Controls: Per-Listing, Per-Category, and Per-Membership Layouts

Listdom doesn't stop at global settings. You can assign layouts conditionally:

➤ **Per Listing (via Pro Addon)**  
In the backend, edit a specific listing. If **Display Options Per Listing** is enabled, you'll see a dropdown to select a layout for that listing only.

Enable this in: **Listdom → Settings → Single Listing → Display Options Per Listing**.  

Choose whether the admin, listing owner, or both can access this feature.

<Aside type="note">
The Display Options Per Listing feature requires the Listdom Pro Addon.
</Aside>

➤ **Per Category (via Pro Addon)**  
To show different templates based on the listing's category (e.g., "Properties" use Slider, "Doctors" use Sidebar):  

**Listdom → Settings → Single Listing → Display Options Per Category**

<Aside type="note">
The Display Options Per Category feature requires the Listdom Pro Addon.
</Aside>

➤ **Per Package Plan (via Subscription Addon)**  
If you want to show different templates to users based on their membership level — for example, giving premium users a richer layout — enable: **Display Options Per Package**.

<Aside type="note">
This feature requires the Listdom Subscription Addon, which lets you assign layouts to specific plans.
</Aside>

## Final Thoughts

Customizing the single listing page in Listdom can be as simple or as advanced as you need it to be.

- If you just want to apply a clean layout across the site, use the built-in skins via **Settings → Single Listing**.  
- If you're building a modern, visually branded website, Elementor and Divi offer complete creative control.  
- For advanced use cases like per-category or per-user layout control, Listdom's Pro and Subscription Addons give you dynamic styling options.
