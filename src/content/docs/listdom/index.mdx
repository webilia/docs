Listdom is a directory & listings plugin for WordPress. It provides a complete data model (Listings + taxonomies), map and search experiences, front-end submission tools, and a flexible shortcode-driven UI that integrates with block editor and popular page builders like Elementor. This overview explains how the pieces fit together so you can plan, build, and scale your directory.

<Aside type="note">
  This is a product overview. For step-by-step install &amp; activation, see [Install the Listdom Plugin &amp; Add-ons](/listdom/installation-and-activation/how-to-install-the-listdom-plugin-and-addons/).
</Aside>

## What You Get in Core

- [Listings](/listdom/managing-listings/add-edit-listing/) (CPT): The main post type you manage and expose on the site.
- Built-in taxonomies: [Categories](/listdom/managing-listings/categories/), [Locations](/listdom/managing-listings/locations/), [Tags](/listdom/managing-listings/tags/), [Labels](/listdom/managing-listings/labels/), and [Features](/listdom/managing-listings/features/) for organizing listings.
- [Maps](/listdom/shortcodes/simple-map/): Google Maps or OpenStreetMap (Leaflet) based rendering within shortcodes and widgets.
- [Search &amp; Filter](/listdom/search-filtering/create-search-filter-form/): Visual search forms and a results view with multiple layouts.
- [Shortcodes](/listdom/shortcodes/categories/) &amp; [Widgets](/listdom/theme-widgets/search/): Dozens of display options; can be placed on any page or in theme widget areas.
- [Front-end Dashboard](/listdom/settings/frontend-dashboard/): Logged-in users can add/manage listings from the front end. Some extras are available in Pro (details below).
- Theme compatibility: Works with most themes; [Listdomer theme](/listdom/listdomer-theme/installation-setup/) adds deep integration and design presets.

## Data Model (post types & taxonomies)

### Listings

- Title / Content / Excerpt: Standard WordPress fields used as listing headline and body.
- Media: Featured image and galleries supported by the single listing templates.
- Coordinates / Address: Used by map providers and distance search (see Maps and Search).

### Taxonomies

- [Categories](/listdom/managing-listings/categories/): Hierarchical grouping (e.g., Food, Hotels, Services).
- [Locations](/listdom/managing-listings/locations/): Hierarchical geography (Country → State → City).
- [Tags](/listdom/managing-listings/tags/): Non-hierarchical keywords.
- [Labels](/listdom/managing-listings/labels/): Small badges like “Featured”, “Open Now”, “Top Rated”.
- [Features](/listdom/managing-listings/features/): Boolean flags/equipment lists (e.g., “Wi-Fi”, “Parking”).

<Aside type="tip">
  When planning your taxonomy structure, prefer [Categories](/listdom/managing-listings/categories/) for primary grouping, [Locations](/listdom/managing-listings/locations/) for geography, [Features](/listdom/managing-listings/features/) for checklists, and [Labels](/listdom/managing-listings/labels/) for editorial flags such as “Featured”.
</Aside>

## Building the UI (shortcodes, blocks, builders)

Listdom’s UI is composable. You can combine shortcodes on any page to produce listing grids, carousels, maps, search forms, and more. All shortcodes accept parameters for layout, filtering, and styling.

- [Shortcodes](/listdom/shortcodes/categories/): Create in Listdom → Shortcodes. Each shortcode can be used on multiple pages.
- Widgets: Theme-side widget areas support Listdom widgets (e.g., [Simple Map](/listdom/theme-widgets/simple-map/), [Search](/listdom/theme-widgets/search/), [Terms](/listdom/theme-widgets/terms/)).
- Page builders: [Elementor](/listdom/addons/elementor/) / [Divi](/listdom/addons/divi/) add-ons provide native widgets that mirror shortcode functionality.

<Aside type="note">
  Some advanced layouts, filters, and builder widgets are contributed by add-ons. Those features appear automatically when the add-on is active and will be noted throughout the docs.
</Aside>

## Maps

- Providers: Google Maps or OpenStreetMap (Leaflet).
- Markers & Info windows: Category/price/label markers; popup info windows on click.
- Clustering & bounds: Auto-clustered markers with zoom/pan controls.
- Geocoding: Address to coordinate resolution for search and display.

<Aside type="tip">
  Use OpenStreetMap (Leaflet) if you prefer a **no-API-key** setup. Switch to Google Maps for **styled maps** and **Directions**. Advanced marker types and styles are expanded by the [Advanced Map Add-on](/listdom/addons/advanced-map/).
</Aside>

## Search & Filter

- Search form builder: Create forms with fields for keywords, category, location, price, custom fields, etc.
- Results view: Grid, list, or map-based results, configurable per form.
- Ordering & pagination: Sort by date, price, distance; paginate or infinite scroll depending on layout.
- URL state: Search selections can be reflected in query params for sharable results.

<Aside type="note">
  Some specialized fields (e.g., **Radius Search**, or **AJAX Search**) may require their respective add-ons. See the [Search &amp; Filter documentation](/listdom/search-filtering/search-form-fields-and-options/) for the full fields catalog.
</Aside>

## Front-end Dashboard

A dedicated user area where logged-in users can add and manage their listings, profile, and (optionally) other commerce flows.

- Core capabilities: [Add/Edit/Delete listings](/listdom/managing-listings/add-edit-listing/), media, taxonomy assignment.
- Guest submission <Badge text="Pro" />: Allow non-registered users to submit listings for review.
- Independent Add Listing Form <Badge text="Pro" />: Embed the submission form outside the dashboard.
- Dashboard menus <Badge text="Pro" />: Extra navigational items (e.g., billing, profile enhancements).

<Aside type="caution">
  Submission permissions, moderation, and default statuses are controlled in Listdom settings. Review your workflow before opening submissions to the public.
</Aside>

## Add-ons Ecosystem (high level)

Extend Listdom with official add-ons. Examples include:

- Monetization: [Subscriptions](/listdom/addons/subscription/), [Ads](/listdom/addons/ads/), [Top-Up](/listdom/addons/topup/), [Labelize](/listdom/addons/labelize/).
- User features: [Favorites](/listdom/addons/favorite/), [Compare](/listdom/addons/compare/), [Reviews/Rating](/listdom/addons/reviews/), [Claim/Verify](/listdom/addons/claim/), [Teams](/listdom/addons/team/).
- Search &amp; UX: [Advanced Map](/listdom/addons/advanced-map/), [APS (Portal Search)](/listdom/addons/advanced-portal-search/), [Advanced Icons](/listdom/addons/advanced-icon/).
- Data &amp; Integration: [CSV](/listdom/addons/csv/) / [Excel](/listdom/addons/excel/) Importer, [Connect](/listdom/addons/connect/), [KML](/listdom/addons/kml/), [Bridge](/listdom/addons/bridge/) &amp; membership integrations.
- Verticals: [Jobs](/listdom/addons/jobs/), [Franchise](/listdom/addons/franchise/), [Auctions](/listdom/addons/auction/), [Booking](/listdom/addons/booking/), [SMS](/listdom/addons/sms/), [Rank](/listdom/addons/rank/).

<Aside type="note">
  Add-ons may add: new settings pages, shortcode parameters, search fields, dashboard menus, and admin columns/metaboxes. Each add-on’s documentation details **where** its options appear across the UI.
</Aside>

## Typical Architecture

1. Data definitions: Prepare [Categories](/listdom/managing-listings/categories/), [Locations](/listdom/managing-listings/locations/), [Features](/listdom/managing-listings/features/), [Labels](/listdom/managing-listings/labels/), [Tags](/listdom/managing-listings/tags/).
2. Listing templates: Decide on single-listing layout and fields.
3. Search experience: Build a [search form](/listdom/search-filtering/create-search-filter-form/) and choose a results layout.
4. Browse pages: Create category/location landing pages with the relevant [shortcodes](/listdom/shortcodes/categories/).
5. Maps: Place a combined map + results page or a simple [map widget](/listdom/theme-widgets/simple-map/).
6. Submission flow: Enable [front-end dashboard](/listdom/settings/frontend-dashboard/) and permissions; add billing if monetizing.
7. Enhancements: Add [Reviews](/listdom/addons/reviews/), [Favorites](/listdom/addons/favorite/), [Compare](/listdom/addons/compare/), and [Labelize](/listdom/addons/labelize/) as needed.

## How to Start with Listdom?

Here we will review the main steps to create the first listings and then show them on the site. A complete step-by-step process of setting up the Listdom listing plugin and getting access to its many powerful features in the best way.

You might also import the Listdom dummy data. In this situation, there are some existing listings and taxonomies on your site. This guide helps you to understand what’s there and where to start.

### Steps Overview

- [Installation and activation of Listdom](/listdom/installation-and-activation/how-to-install-the-listdom-plugin-and-addons/): Listdom is a WordPress plugin. So first you need to install it on your site.
- [Add-ons installation](/listdom/installation-and-activation/how-to-install-the-listdom-plugin-and-addons/): Listdom add-ons can add extra features to the Listdom main plugin.
- [Settings](/listdom/settings/general/): Like any other new plugin on your site, after installation, you have to configure it.
- [First listing creation](/listdom/managing-listings/add-edit-listing/): It’s time to create the first listing based on your website niche and purpose.
- Configuration of the listing taxonomies: A listing page, also called a directory page, is the main part of the plugin. Each item on your directory site like jobs, hotels, ads, cars, homes, etc. is a listing. The listings can be gathered in different groups with the same taxonomy. [Categories](/listdom/managing-listings/categories/), [Labels](/listdom/managing-listings/labels/), and [Tags](/listdom/managing-listings/tags/) are some of them. Also, they can have some [custom fields](/listdom/managing-listings/custom-fields/) too.
- Skin choosing and shortcode creation: You can show a list of the listings in different styles and skins on any of your site pages. To do that you have to create [shortcodes](/listdom/shortcodes/categories/). Each shortcode can be inserted in site pages with various methods.
- Setting up search and filter forms: The list of the directories (listings) can have a [search or filter form](/listdom/search-filtering/create-search-filter-form/) on top or any other position.
- Setting up frontend dashboard: Listdom helps you to have a [dashboard](/listdom/settings/frontend-dashboard/) page that enables your site users to submit listings without entering the WordPress admin space.

### Quick Start (end-to-end)

3. Add a few [Listings](/listdom/managing-listings/add-edit-listing/) with addresses/coordinates and media.
4. Build a [Shortcode](/listdom/shortcodes/categories/) for listings (grid/list) and insert it on a page named **All Listings**.
5. Build a [Search Form](/listdom/search-filtering/create-search-filter-form/) (choose fields &amp; results layout) and publish a **Search** page.
6. Add a [Map](/listdom/shortcodes/simple-map/) shortcode or widget to your homepage.

</Steps>

### Installation and Activation of Listdom

The first step to start using Listdom is to install and activate the plugin. You can download the Listdom from the WordPress repository. For more detailed information, you can read the full guide on [how to install and activate Listdom](/listdom/installation-and-activation/how-to-install-the-listdom-plugin-and-addons/).

### Add-ons Installation

Several add-ons add incredible features to the Listdom. You can see the list of the Listdom add-ons in the [add-ons documentation](/listdom/addons/ads/). To see the full list of the documentation of each of them, you can see the Listdom add-ons documentation.

### Overall Settings

Before publishing your first listing, there are some settings that you must pay attention to. The settings consist of several topics including Google Recaptcha, maps settings, colors, fonts, etc. The settings are not required to use Listdom. But you need them to add extra functionalities to your site. For example, to use Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, you need to get an API from them. To increase the security of your site, the Google Recaptcha Site and Security keys are required. The details of each part can be achieved through [Listdom settings](/listdom/settings/general/) documentation.

### First Listings Creation

Now it’s time to create your first listing. As it was said, a listing is the main item of your directory site. Everything starts from entering a name and continues with various options to modify its appearance and functions. If you’re looking for a starting point, read the [Listdom listing creation guide](/listdom/managing-listings/add-edit-listing/). Also, you may want to bulk import your pre-made listings. In this case, you can use the [Listdom Import / Export](/listdom/import-export/csv/) feature.

### Configuration of the Listing Taxonomies

The listings taxonomies play a main role on your directory site. You can create different [categories](/listdom/managing-listings/categories/), [labels](/listdom/managing-listings/labels/), [tags](/listdom/managing-listings/tags/), and [locations](/listdom/managing-listings/locations/), and assign them to desired listings. For example, you can create a location named New York. Then you can choose it on the desired listing’s setting to be their default location. The Listdom taxonomies guide can be helpful here. To create and manage the [custom fields](/listdom/managing-listings/custom-fields/) (attributes) click here.

### Skin Choosing and Shortcode Creation

After publishing the listings, it’s time to show a list of them on your site. You can show your listings in different skins and views including List view, Grid view, Half Map view, Table view, and many more. With some settings applied, Listdom has over 80 ready views that can be used with any WordPress theme.

Listdom has a powerful [shortcode builder](/listdom/skins-shortcodes/shortcodes-common-settings/) that generates specific shortcodes with desired settings. Based on the page builder or editor you use like WordPress Classic Editor, Block Editor, Elementor, etc., you can insert the shortcodes with different methods in your site. Mostly it’s possible to paste the shortcode term directly in a text area or use a Shortcode widget/module.

### Setting Up Search and Filter Forms

Listdom search and filter builder empowers you to create simple to advanced forms to assign to your shortcodes. To learn more, take a look at the [Search &amp; Filter builder](/listdom/search-filtering/create-search-filter-form/) documentation.

### Setting Up Dashboard

Until now, you have completed your directory site. If you need your site users to be able to publish listings, it’s time to make the Listdom frontend dashboard. To learn more you can read [Listdom frontend dashboard](/listdom/settings/frontend-dashboard/) documentation. That’s it. Creating your directory site is as easy as this. Enjoy the Listdom.
