## What You Get in Core

- Listings (CPT): The main post type you manage and expose on the site.
- Built-in taxonomies: Categories, Locations, Tags, Labels, and Features for organizing listings.
- Maps: Google Maps or OpenStreetMap (Leaflet) based rendering within shortcodes and widgets.
- Search & Filter: Visual search forms and a results view with multiple layouts.
- Shortcodes & Widgets: Dozens of display options; can be placed on any page or in theme widget areas.
- Front-end Dashboard: Logged-in users can add/manage listings from the front end. Some extras are available in Pro <Badge text="Pro" /> (details below).
- Theme compatibility: Works with most themes; Listdomer theme adds deep integration and design presets.

## Data Model (post types & taxonomies)

### Listings

- Title / Content / Excerpt: Standard WordPress fields used as listing headline and body.
- Media: Featured image and galleries supported by the single listing templates.
- Coordinates / Address: Used by map providers and distance search (see Maps and Search).

### Taxonomies

- Categories: Hierarchical grouping (e.g., Food, Hotels, Services).
- Locations: Hierarchical geography (Country → State → City).
- Tags: Non-hierarchical keywords.
- Labels: Small badges like “Featured”, “Open Now”, “Top Rated”.
- Features: Boolean flags/equipment lists (e.g., “Wi-Fi”, “Parking”).

<Aside type="tip">
  When planning your taxonomy structure, prefer **Categories** for primary grouping, **Locations** for geography, **Features** for checklists, and **Labels** for editorial flags such as “Featured”.
</Aside>

## Building the UI (shortcodes, blocks, builders)

Listdom’s UI is composable. You can combine shortcodes on any page to produce listing grids, carousels, maps, search forms, and more. All shortcodes accept parameters for layout, filtering, and styling.

- Shortcodes: Create in Listdom → Shortcodes. Each shortcode can be used on multiple pages.
- Widgets: Theme-side widget areas support Listdom widgets (e.g., Simple Map, Search, Terms).
- Page builders: Elementor/Divi add-ons provide native widgets that mirror shortcode functionality.

<Aside type="note">
  Some advanced layouts, filters, and builder widgets are contributed by add-ons. Those features appear automatically when the add-on is active and will be noted throughout the docs.
</Aside>

## Maps

- Providers: Google Maps or OpenStreetMap (Leaflet).
- Markers & Info windows: Category/price/label markers; popup info windows on click.
- Clustering & bounds: Auto-clustered markers with zoom/pan controls.
- Geocoding: Address to coordinate resolution for search and display.

<Aside type="tip">
  Use OpenStreetMap (Leaflet) if you prefer a **no-API-key** setup. Switch to Google Maps for **styled maps** and **Directions**. Advanced marker types and styles are expanded by the **Advanced Map Add-on**.
</Aside>

## Search & Filter

- Search form builder: Create forms with fields for keywords, category, location, price, custom fields, etc.
- Results view: Grid, list, or map-based results, configurable per form.
- Ordering & pagination: Sort by date, price, distance; paginate or infinite scroll depending on layout.
- URL state: Search selections can be reflected in query params for sharable results.

<Aside type="note">
  Some specialized fields (e.g., **Radius Search**, or **AJAX Search**) may require their respective add-ons. See the “Search & Filter” docs for the full fields catalog.
</Aside>

## Front-end Dashboard

A dedicated user area where logged-in users can add and manage their listings, profile, and (optionally) other commerce flows.

- Core capabilities: Add/Edit/Delete listings, media, taxonomy assignment.
- Guest submission <Badge text="Pro" />: Allow non-registered users to submit listings for review.
- Independent Add Listing Form <Badge text="Pro" />: Embed the submission form outside the dashboard.
- Dashboard menus <Badge text="Pro" />: Extra navigational items (e.g., billing, profile enhancements).

<Aside type="caution">
  Submission permissions, moderation, and default statuses are controlled in Listdom settings. Review your workflow before opening submissions to the public.
</Aside>

## Add-ons Ecosystem (high level)

Extend Listdom with official add-ons. Examples include:

- Monetization: Subscriptions, Ads, Top-Up, Labelize.
- User features: Favorites, Compare, Reviews/Rating, Claim/Verify, Teams.
- Search & UX: Advanced Map, APS (Portal Search), Advanced Icons.
- Data & Integration: CSV/Excel Importer, Connect, KML, Bridge & membership integrations.
- Verticals: Jobs, Franchise, Auctions, Booking, SMS, Rank.

<Aside type="note">
  Add-ons may add: new settings pages, shortcode parameters, search fields, dashboard menus, and admin columns/metaboxes. Each add-on’s documentation details **where** its options appear across the UI.
</Aside>

## Typical Architecture

1. Data definitions: Prepare Categories, Locations, Features, Labels, Tags.
2. Listing templates: Decide on single-listing layout and fields.
3. Search experience: Build a search form and choose a results layout.
4. Browse pages: Create category/location landing pages with the relevant shortcodes.
5. Maps: Place a combined map + results page or a simple map widget.
6. Submission flow: Enable front-end dashboard and permissions; add billing if monetizing.
7. Enhancements: Add Reviews, Favorites, Compare, and Labelize as needed.
