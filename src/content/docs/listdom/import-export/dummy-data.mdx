## Dummy Data

The Dummy Data tab is under **Listdom → Import/Export**, designed to streamline the setup process for your Listdom-powered directory website. This feature provides pre-built sample content and configurations—including listings, categories, locations, tags, labels, shortcodes, pages, and more—that serve as a practical starting point, allowing you to quickly build a functional demo or test environment without manually creating every element from scratch.

Using dummy data is especially helpful when you want to explore Listdom’s full capabilities or demonstrate the plugin’s features to clients before adding real content. You retain full control over what is imported and can delete the dummy content at any time without affecting your live data.

## What’s Included in Dummy Data?

- **Listings:** Sample directory entries complete with descriptions, images, and meta details.  
- **Categories:** Predefined categories to organize your listings.  
- **Locations:** Location taxonomies that enable location-based filtering.  
- **Tags:** Sample tags that add additional filtering and search granularity.  
- **Features:** Custom feature sets applied to listings.  
- **Labels:** Custom labels such as “Recommended,” “VIP,” or other badges.  
- **Custom Fields:** Sample custom fields that extend listing details.  
- **Frontend Dashboard:** A ready-to-use frontend dashboard setup for user submissions and management.  
- **Shortcodes & Pages:** Pre-built shortcode configurations and essential pages that create the foundation of your directory site.
