## Problem

**Why are the sections on the page in a box?**  
**How to change the settings so that my page sections are full width and the page title doesn't show?**

## Answer

The layout of a page is mostly determined by the website theme. However, you can override the theme settings for a specific page. Go to the page editor and, based on your page builder, look for the **Template** option. The Template option will display the templates that are available for the page. **Full-width templates** are a good choice if you want to display the page content in full-width format.

## How to Fix

<Steps>
1. **Edit the Page:** Go to the WordPress dashboard and edit the page in question.  
2. **Locate the Template Option:** Based on your page builder, look for the **Template** option in the page settings.  
3. **Choose Full-Width Template:** Select a full-width template if available. This will make your page sections stretch across the full width of the page.  
4. **Hide the Page Title:** Many full-width templates also include options to hide the page title. Enable this option if you donâ€™t want the title displayed.  
</Steps>

In the **WordPress Block Editor**, you can find the template option as shown in the image below:
