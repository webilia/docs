## Problem

**I can't find the Display Options on the "Add Listing" page or anywhere.**

The **Display Options** are used to adjust the listing details page and elements visibility for each listing. If you cannot find this section on the Add Listing page, this article can help you.

## Answer

<Aside type="note">
The "Display Options" are only available when the **Listdom Pro Add-on** is installed and active.
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. **Ensure Listdom Pro Add-on is Active**  
   First, confirm that the Pro addon is installed and activated. Without it, the "Display Options" section will not appear.

2. **Configure Display Options**  
   - Navigate to **Listdom → Settings → Single Listing**.  
   - Locate the **Display Options Per Listing** field.  
   - Select the appropriate option:  
     - **Admin and Listing Owner:** Display options available to both.  
     - **Admin Only:** Restrict display options to admin.  
     - **Disabled:** No display options visible.  

   This setting controls who can see and edit display options for each listing. If it's set to "Disabled," the options will not appear.  

3. **Additional Notes**  
   If you're still having trouble after confirming the Pro addon and settings:  
   - Try clearing the site cache.  
   - Deactivate other plugins to check for conflicts.
