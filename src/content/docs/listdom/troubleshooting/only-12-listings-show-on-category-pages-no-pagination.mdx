## Problem

When clicking on a listing category (e.g., from a taxonomy link or widget), the page loads and shows 12 listing results, but there is no option to view additional listings and no pagination or load more button appears. Other categories behave the same.

## Answer

If your category pages in Listdom only display 12 listings and don’t show a “Load More” button or any pagination, this article will help you identify and fix the issue. This issue is usually caused by the **Pagination Method** being set to “Disabled” in the shortcode that generates the archive page. In Listdom, category archive pages can be powered by shortcodes (if configured in Listdom settings). If the shortcode in use has pagination disabled, it will stop displaying listings after the initial **Limit** (commonly set to 12).

## How to Fix It

Follow these steps to enable pagination or “Load More” functionality for your category pages:

<Steps>
1. **Check Archive Page Settings**  
   - Go to your WordPress dashboard.  
   - Navigate to **Listdom → Settings → General → Archive Pages**.  
   - Under **Category**, check if a shortcode is selected.  
   - If a shortcode is assigned here, this is the one used to render your category listings.

2. **Edit the Shortcode Settings**  
   - Go to **Listdom → Shortcodes**.  
   - Find and **Edit** the shortcode identified in the previous step.  
   - Locate the setting called **Pagination Method**.  
   - This can usually be found under the **Layout** tab of the shortcode builder.

3. **Change the Pagination Method**  
   If it’s set to **Disabled**, change it to one of the following:  
   - **Load More Button:** Shows a “Load More” button at the bottom of the listing results.  
   - **Infinite Scroll:** Automatically loads more listings as the user scrolls down.  
   - **Numeric:** Divides the listings into several pages and adds the page numbers.  

   ✅ Don’t leave it as “Disabled,” or your listing results will be limited to the first batch (e.g., 12 items).

4. **Save the Shortcode**  
   After updating the pagination setting, click **Save** or **Update** on the shortcode.  
   Now revisit the category page on the frontend and refresh it. You should see pagination working, either with a button or infinite scroll.
</Steps>

## Why This Happens

Listdom shortcodes are very flexible, but when **Pagination Method** is set to “Disabled,” the shortcode will only display the initial limit of listings — and will not load any more, even if more listings exist. This setting is useful when you want a compact listing block, but it’s not ideal for archive pages.

## Summary

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Only 12 listings show on category pages | Edit the assigned shortcode and set **Pagination Method** to **Load More** or **Infinite Scroll** |
