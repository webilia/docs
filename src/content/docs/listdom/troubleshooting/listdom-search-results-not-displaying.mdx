## Problem

**I am using the Listdom plugin. I've created a search form, but when I search by location or category, either no results appear or I get redirected to the homepage. What should I do?**

## Answer

When the Listdom search form is configured but either doesn't return results or unexpectedly redirects to the homepage, the problem is usually related to how the **search form, skin shortcode, and results page** settings are configured.

Here's a comprehensive troubleshooting guide to help you resolve this issue step by step.

## Steps to Resolve

<Steps>
1. **Check That Listings Exist and Are Published**  
   - Navigate to **Listings → All Listings**.  
   - Confirm that listings are published and assigned to relevant categories, locations, features, and tags.  
   - Listings must have values that match the filters in your search form; otherwise, results will appear empty.  
   - Try a search without any filters to test if listings appear at all.  

2. **Set the Correct Search Results Page**  
   - Go to **Listdom → Search and Filter Builder**, and open the search form you're using.  
   - In the **Search Results panel**:  
     - If your skin shortcode and search form are on the same page, set **Results Page** to "Current Page."  
       This will automatically apply the search filters to all skin shortcodes on that page.  
     - If you're using the APS Addon, a **Connected Shortcodes** option appears.  
       Select the exact shortcode(s) you want to target and specify whether to apply the filter **On Submit** (after clicking search) or **On the Fly** (live as users select options).  
     - If you select a different page as the Results Page:  
       Ensure that page contains a skin shortcode.  
       If multiple shortcodes exist on the page, you must define the **Target Shortcode** to avoid applying filters globally.  

3. **Ensure a Skin Shortcode is Present on the Results Page**  
   - Regardless of where the results will be shown (current or another page), a **skin shortcode** must be added there.  
   - Go to **Listdom → Shortcodes**.  
   - Create a skin shortcode (e.g., List, Grid, Single Map, etc.).  
   - Choose your layout and filters.  
   - If desired, assign the search form to the shortcode (only if you're not using the search form separately).  
   - Add the generated shortcode to the page using the WordPress editor, Elementor, or WPBakery.  
   Without a skin shortcode on the target page, no search results will appear—even if the search form itself is working properly.  

4. **Check APS Addon Settings (If Installed)**  
   - If you're using the Advanced Portal Search (APS) Addon, double-check the following:  
     - **Matching Logic (OR/AND):** Under **Listdom → Settings → Addons → Advanced Portal Search**:  
       OR = more inclusive results (default).  
       AND = stricter filters, may result in 0 results if no listing matches all terms.  
     - **AJAX Search Mode:**  
       - Disabled: Page reload needed to show results.  
       - Enabled: User must press the Search button; results load via AJAX.  
       - On the Fly: Results update instantly as the user selects options.  

5. **Check for Technical Conflicts**  
   - If everything seems configured correctly but results still don't appear:  
     - Clear caches: Browser, site cache, and plugin caches.  
     - **JavaScript Errors:** Check developer console (F12 → Console) for script issues.  
     - **Plugin Conflicts:** Deactivate non-essential plugins and test.  
     - **Theme Conflicts:** Temporarily switch to a default WordPress theme (e.g., Twenty Twenty-Four).  
</Steps>

## Why This Works

To ensure your Listdom search form works properly:

- Assign a valid results page (same or another page).  
- Ensure a skin shortcode exists on that page.  
- Confirm listings exist that match your filters.  

With the right configuration, your search should return accurate results without redirects or empty states.  

If the problem continues, provide:  
- The name of the shortcode you're using.  
- A link to your search page.  
- Or a screenshot of your settings.  

This will help support debug further.
