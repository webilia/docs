## Problem

**Why the Recaptcha site and security keys are not working?**  
I got a message like: **ERROR for site owner: Invalid Key type.**

## Answer

If you encounter an error while using the reCAPTCHA, it’s most likely because you’re using the wrong version. **Listdom uses reCAPTCHA version 2**, and if you have the keys for version 3, you’ll get an error. To resolve this, ensure you’re using the correct reCAPTCHA key type for your website.

## How to Fix

<Steps>
1. **Check Your Keys**  
   Ensure that you have correctly used both the site and security keys on your website. The keys must be entered in the **Listdom → Settings** section.  

2. **Add the Correct Domain**  
   - Go to the reCAPTCHA management page and log in with your Google account.  
   - Select the correct site key from the dropdown list.  
   - Under **Domains**, add the correct domain associated with your website.  

3. **Verify Key Type**  
   Make sure you are using the appropriate reCAPTCHA key type (version 2) for your website.  
</Steps>
