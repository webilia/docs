## Problem

**I installed a Listdom add-on but it's not showing on the website!**

## Answer

If you've installed a Listdom add-on but it's not appearing on your website, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:

<Steps>
1. **Add-on Installation**  
   Make sure you installed the correct add-on on your WordPress website and also make sure that you activated the plugin. Each Listdom add-on is a separate WordPress plugin that you need to download from your **Webilia Account → My Account** page and install on your website.  
   Also, ensure the plugin is activated. Learn more in [How to Install the Listdom Plugin and Add-ons](/listdom/installation-and-activation/how-to-install-the-listdom-plugin-and-add-ons/).

2. **License Activation**  
   You need to activate the add-on license. You can find your license code in your **Webilia account**. Insert the license code in the license activation form and make sure it gets activated without any issues.  
   If your license is expired or you don't have a license code, you need to get one from Webilia. Learn more in [How to Activate the Listdom Add-ons Licenses](/listdom/installation-and-activation/how-to-activate-the-listdom-addons-licenses/).

3. **Add-ons Settings**  
   Check the **Listdom → Settings → Addons** section to see if the feature you're looking for has any options that need to be enabled.

4. **Elements Deactivation**  
   Each element in the listing details page can be deactivated on several levels. Ensure that the feature you are looking for is not disabled:  
   - **Listing Details Page:** If the add-on includes elements to display on the listing details page, ensure they are enabled. Navigate to **Listdom → Settings → Single Listing → Elements** to verify this.  
   - **Category Deactivation:** Listdom lets you deactivate elements at the category level. This means that all of the listings in a particular category will not display selected elements. Check the category settings.  
   - **Global Deactivation:** To enable a section on all listings' final detail pages, go to **Listdom → Settings → Single Listing → Elements** and toggle the section you want.  
   - **Frontend Submission Form Deactivation:** To disable or enable a field on the Add Listing form of the Frontend dashboard, navigate to **Listdom → Settings → Frontend Dashboard** tab and configure accordingly.

5. **Page Builders Problem**  
   If you're using the Listdom Divi or Listdom Elementor add-on to design your listing cards or details page, you may need to update the styles and add the new widget from the recently installed add-on.  
   For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Divi Add-on Documentation](/listdom/addons/divi/) or the [Elementor Add-on Documentation](/listdom/addons/elementor/).
