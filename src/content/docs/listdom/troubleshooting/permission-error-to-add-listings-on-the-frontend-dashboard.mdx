## Problem

**On the Frontend Dashboard, the users cannot add listing.**  
It returns a **'You do not have permission to add a listing'** error message.

## Answer

If you’ve set up Listdom Pro and Subscriptions add-ons and configured a paid package but are encountering the “You do not have permission to add a listing” error for paid listings, follow these steps to resolve the issue.

## Understanding the Issue

The error is related to **user roles** rather than the Listdom package configuration.  
Listdom adds two specific roles called **“Listdom Author”** and **“Listdom Publisher”** to the WordPress user roles designed to manage listing permissions effectively.  

- The listings of the user with the **Listdom Publisher** role will be published automatically.  
- The **Listdom Author** listings will be in pending status unless the site admin publishes them.

## Steps to Resolve

<Steps>
1. **Assign the New Roles:**  
   - Navigate to the WordPress dashboard.  
   - Go to **Users → All Users**.  
   - Select the user experiencing the issue.  
   - Change their role to **Listdom Author** or **Listdom Publisher**.  

2. **Set Default User Role for New Users:**  
   - Go to **Settings → General** in the WordPress dashboard.  
   - Set the **New User Default Role** to **Listdom Author** or **Listdom Publisher**.  
   - This ensures all new users have the appropriate permissions to add listings.  
</Steps>

## What Is the Difference Between Listdom Author and Listdom Publisher Roles?

- **Listdom Publisher:** Listings are published automatically.  
- **Listdom Author:** Listings remain in pending status unless published by the site admin.  

## Higher Roles

You can alternatively assign higher roles like **Author** or **Editor**, but be aware these roles grant additional access beyond Listdom functionalities.

## Why This Works

The **Listdom Author** or **Listdom Publisher** roles are specifically tailored to provide the necessary permissions for adding listings without granting excess capabilities that come with higher roles like **Author** or **Editor**.  

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the permissions issue and allow users to add listings successfully.
