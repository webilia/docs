Creating search fields on directories You can add your desired fields to the search form for advanced search. Determining different fields for searching in the Listdom WordPress directory plugin is done easily. You can adjust it depending on your needs and the tags and categories created on your directory items.

Listdom search and filter forms consist of different fields. Each of them has its own options and settings. They can be used in the rows of the form easily with drag and drop. Let’s review them.

If the “Default Value” is filled. the placeholder will not be displayed until the user deletes that. The placeholder is optional and if not entered, the field Title will be displayed as the placeholder.
- **Default Value:** Enter a value to be the default entry of the field. If the user doesn’t change the default value, then the search will be performed based on that value. This field is optional.

- **Default Value:** Enter a value to be the default entry of the field. If the user doesn’t change the default value, then the search will be performed based on that value.

## Price Field

- **Dropdown+:** This field allows users to choose a minimum price for a listing. Listings with a price below the minimum are filtered out. You can define the minimum, maximum, and increment for the dropdown prices. Additionally, the thousands separator can be enabled to improve the appearance of the large numbers.
- **Min/Max Input:** This method is the same as a Text Input method except that an additional entry for the maximum price value is also added to the field.

## Price Class Field

This is a dropdown field and the user can select the price class of the listings. Other settings are the same as taxonomy fields.

## Address Field

The Address field options are also the same as the other fields and only the “Methods” are different. the available methods are:

- **Text Input:** It is the default method. The user should enter a desired address, city, country, etc. to find the listings in that area.
- **Radius Search:** With this field, the user can determine the radius length of the address search. The user should enter a desired address, city, country, etc. along with a number in meters to find the listings in that radius. By choosing this method the following options appear:
  - **Radius (Meters):** Set the default number of the radius in meters.
  - **Display Radius Field:** Select “Yes” to show the Redius entry in the form so the user can change the default radius length.
- **Radius Search (Dropdown):** It’s like the Radius search except that the radius values are pre-defined by the admin. By choosing this method the following options appear:
  - **Radius Values (Meters):** Enter the available values of the radius search to show in the dropdown.

For better functionality, it’s suggested to insert a complete address, and not just a single word, in the address field. This will ensure that the search results are as accurate as possible.
