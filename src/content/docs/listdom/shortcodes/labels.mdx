The **Labels** shortcode `[listdom_label]` displays Listing Labels, which are a taxonomy of labels/tags you assign to listings. Labels can be used for special flags like “Featured”, “Sold”, or any custom tag. This shortcode lets you list all labels in one place.

*(Note: “Labels” in Listdom are a flat taxonomy similar to tags. They are not hierarchical.)*

## Display Options

- `style`: Choose the layout style for label display. Options are **`simple`** or **`clean`**. *Default:* `clean`.  
  – **simple:** Outputs labels as a plain text list (can be multi-column with `grid`).  
  – **clean:** Outputs labels in a cleaner block format (similar to categories clean style, with potential icon/color circle if configured).
- `grid`: (For **simple** or **clean** styles) Number of columns per row for listing labels. Allowed values: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6`. *Default:* `3` (in simple style) or `2` (in clean style). If an unsupported value is given, it defaults to 3. This setting controls how many label items appear in each row.
- `show_count`: Whether to show the number of listings associated with each label next to the label name. Use `1` to display counts or `0` to hide them. *Default:* Off (labels will display without counts unless enabled).

## Filtering Options

- `hide_empty`: Set to `1` to hide labels that have no listings, or `0` to include even empty labels. *Default:* `0` (show all labels, including those not used by any listing).
- `ids`: Comma-separated list of specific Label IDs to show. If provided, only those labels will be listed. Example: `ids="7,15,22"` will output only the labels with those IDs.
- `search`: Filter labels by a keyword. Only labels whose names contain the search term will be shown. For example, `search="Featured"` will match any labels with “Featured” in the name.
- `orderby`: Field to sort labels by. Common options: `name` for alphabetical, `count` for number of listings using that label. *Default:* `name` (alphabetical A–Z).
- `order`: Sort direction, either `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending). *Default:* `ASC`. For instance, to list labels by popularity, use `orderby="count" order="DESC"`.

Since Labels are not hierarchical, the `hierarchical` and `parent` parameters are not applicable to this shortcode. Each label will be listed as an individual item.

<Aside type="note">
Listing Labels are available in all versions of Listdom. Assign labels to your listings (via the listing edit screen) to use this shortcode effectively. There is no Pro restriction on labels.

## Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
    **Highlight Specific Labels:**  
    If you only want to show certain important labels, for example “Open Now” and “Featured”, you could use `\[listdom_label style="clean" ids="5,6"\]` (assuming 5 and 6 are the IDs of those labels). This will output just those labels in a clean grid format.

    **Labels Search Filter:**  
    You can create a page section for a specific subset of labels. E.g., `\[listdom_label search="New"\]` will list all labels containing “New” in their name (such as “New Opening” or “New Listing”). This can help users find new or special listings quickly.
