Listdomer works seamlessly with WordPress widgets to display content in sidebars and footers.

## Widget Areas (Sidebars)

The theme registers several widget areas for flexible content placement:

- **Main Sidebar:** Appears on blog pages (archives and single posts) when using a sidebar layout. This sidebar’s default ID is “sidebar-1” and typically shows on the right (or left) side of blog content. You can add widgets like Search, Recent Posts, or any custom widget here via Appearance > Widgets. <Badge text="Tip" />
- **Footer 1, 2, 3, 4:** Four widget columns in the footer. These are used by footer layouts that have multiple columns. Footer Type 1 might place these four side by side. Add widgets to each to populate your footer columns.
- **Sub-Footer (Footer Menu):** Not a widget area, but a menu location for a thin bar below the footer widgets.

To add content, go to Appearance > Widgets (or the Widgets editor in Customizer if using WordPress 5.8+). Drag and drop desired widgets into “Sidebar” or “Footer 1/2/3/4”. Common uses include placing a Search widget and Categories in the Sidebar for blog navigation, and adding a Text or Custom HTML widget to Footer 1 for an “About us” blurb.

<Aside type="note">If you imported a demo, the widget areas may already have content. You can edit or replace these to make the footer your own.</Aside>
