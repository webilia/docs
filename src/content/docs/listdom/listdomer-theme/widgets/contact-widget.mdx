Listdomer Core provides a custom widget called "(Listdomer) Contact" for use especially in footers.

## Widget Features

- **Logo and Site Name:** Automatically shows your Site Logo or Site Title at top for branding.
- **Contact Info:** Fields for Email and Phone - if you fill these in the widget settings, they'll be displayed as "Phone: [your number]" and "Email: [your email]" with appropriate labels. Leave blank any field you don't want shown.
- **Social Icons:** Enter URLs for various social networks (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, WhatsApp, Telegram) in the widget settings. The widget will display an icon for each service that links to your provided URL.

Add this widget to a Footer widget area to create a "Contact us" column. In Appearance > Widgets, add (Listdomer) Contact to your desired sidebar, give it a Title, and fill in your contact info.

<Aside type="note">Remember to update the placeholder email and phone to your actual details before publishing.</Aside>
