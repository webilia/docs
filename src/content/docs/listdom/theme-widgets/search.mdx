The Search widget adds a Listdom search form to any widget area. This lets users filter your listings by whatever criteria you've set up (such as keyword, location, category, price, etc.). The actual fields and filters are configured via **Listdom → Search & Filter Builder** forms (the search builder); this widget simply displays one of those forms in the front-end.

## Widget Options

### Title
An optional title for the widget (for example, "Search Listings"). It will appear above the search form. Leave blank if you prefer not to display a title.

### Search Form
Select which Listdom search form to display. The dropdown will list all available search forms you have created in **Listdom → Search & Filter Builder**. (Each search form corresponds to a saved search template with specific fields and filters.)

- **Choose a Search Form** – Pick the search form you want to render. There is no default; you must select one of your created forms.

If no search forms are available in the dropdown, you may need to first create a search form in the Listdom Search builder. Once you have at least one, it will appear as a selectable option here.

When placed on your site, the widget will show the fields of the chosen search form. Users can fill in the criteria and submit to filter listings accordingly.

<Aside type="tip">
You can create multiple search forms for different purposes (e.g., a simple search with just a keyword and location, and an advanced search with many filters). Then, use this widget multiple times in different areas, each with a different search form selected.

## Add-On Features

The Search widget's functionality can be extended with add-ons, depending on the fields in your chosen search form:

- **Booking Add-on** - If you have the _Listdom Booking_ add-on active, your search forms can include booking-specific fields (like check-in/check-out dates or guest count). Those fields will appear in the widget's form when applicable. <Badge text="Pro" />

In short, the widget will display whatever fields the selected search form contains. Add-ons primarily add new field types to the search form builder, which then appear in this widget.

## Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
    **Simple Keyword Search:** Create a basic search form (e.g., just a keyword search field) in Listdom's search builder. Add the Search widget to your sidebar and select this simple form. Users can quickly type a keyword and find relevant listings without leaving the sidebar.

    **Advanced Filters in a Sidebar:** Suppose you build an advanced search form with filters for Category, Location, Price Range, and Tag. By adding the Search widget with this form to your sidebar, users on any page can refine listings by those criteria. This is great for sites where visitors might want to drill down results from any page.
