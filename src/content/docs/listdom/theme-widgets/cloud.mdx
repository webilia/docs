The Cloud widget displays a tag cloud of Listdom terms, such as Tags or Categories. Terms are shown in varying font sizes (usually reflecting their usage frequency), letting users see popular listing topics at a glance. This widget functions similarly to WordPress's Tag Cloud, but for Listdom's custom taxonomies.

## Widget Options

### Title
An optional title for the widget (e.g. "Popular Tags"). Leave blank for no title.

### Taxonomy
Choose which listing taxonomy to display as a cloud:

- **Tags** <Badge text="Default" /> - Listing tags (free-form keywords attached to listings).
- **Categories** - Listing categories (primary categories or types of listings).
- **Locations** - Listing locations (geographical terms).
- **Features** - Listing features/amenities.
- **Labels** - Listing labels or statuses.

<Aside type="note">
If you have Listdom Pro, an additional **Custom Fields** taxonomy (Attributes) is available in this list, allowing you to display a cloud of custom attribute terms. <Badge text="Pro" />
</Aside>

### Display Count
Whether to show the number of listings for each term:

- **No** <Badge text="Default" /> - Display just the term name.
- **Yes** - Display each term name followed by the number of listings in parentheses.

For example, a term might appear as "Restaurants (12)" if Display Count is Yes.

### Hide Empty
Choose whether terms with zero listings should be included:

- **Yes** <Badge text="Default" /> - Hide terms that have no listings.
- **No** - Show all terms even if they currently have no listings.

Typically, you'll keep this set to Yes so that the cloud only shows relevant terms.

### Sort By
How to sort the terms in the cloud:

- **Name** <Badge text="Default" /> - Sort terms alphabetically.
- **Count** - Sort terms by the number of listings (descending), so more popular terms appear first.

### Limit
The maximum number of terms to display in the cloud. Default: 24. The widget will include up to this many terms, chosen based on the sort order above. You can adjust this number if you want a larger or smaller cloud.

_(If there are more terms than the limit, only the top terms (by name or count) will be shown.)_

## Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
    **Popular Tags Cloud:** Place the Cloud widget in your sidebar to show a cloud of popular listing tags. For instance, on a real estate site, visitors might see tags like *Apartment*, *Villa*, or *Downtown* grow larger if they're used more often.
  </Card>
  <Card>
    **Multiple Clouds by Taxonomy:** You can add this widget twice - one showing a **Categories** cloud and another showing **Locations**. Give each a distinct title (e.g., "Listing Categories" and "Locations") to help users filter listings by those groupings.
