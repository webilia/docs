The Terms widget inserts a list of Listdom taxonomy terms (Categories, Tags, Locations, etc.) into your sidebar or widget area. It functions similarly to the built-in WordPress "Categories" widget, allowing users to navigate listings by taxonomy. You can choose one taxonomy and configure how it's displayed (flat list or dropdown, with counts, hierarchical or not).

## Widget Options

### Title
An optional title for the widget (e.g. "Browse Listings by Category"). This appears above the list of terms. You can leave it blank to display no title.

### Taxonomy
Select which Listdom taxonomy to list:

- **Tags** <Badge text="Default" /> – Listing Tags.
- **Categories** – Listing Categories.
- **Locations** – Listing Locations.
- **Features** – Listing Features.
- **Labels** – Listing Labels.

<Aside type="note">
In Listdom Pro, you'll also see **Custom Fields** (Attributes) as a taxonomy choice. This allows you to list custom attribute terms as a filter. <Badge text="Pro" />
</Aside>

Only one taxonomy can be shown per widget instance. To list multiple taxonomies, you can add multiple Terms widgets (one for each taxonomy needed).

### Display as Dropdown
Choose how to display the terms:

- **No** <Badge text="Default" /> – Display the terms as a vertical list.
- **Yes** – Display the terms in a dropdown menu.

Using a dropdown can save space if you have many terms. When a user selects a term from the dropdown, it will jump to that term's archive of listings.

### Display Count
Whether to show the number of listings next to each term:

- **No** <Badge text="Default" /> – Show just the term name.
- **Yes** – Show the count of listings in that term, in parentheses after the name.

For example, with _Display Count_ = **Yes**, a category might display as **"Hotels (27)"** if there are 27 listings in **Hotels**.

### Hierarchical
This setting applies mainly to hierarchical taxonomies like Categories (which can have parent/child terms):

- **No** <Badge text="Default" /> – Display all terms in a flat list (ignoring hierarchy).
- **Yes** – Indent child terms under their parents to reflect the term hierarchy.

If the selected taxonomy doesn't have hierarchy (e.g., Tags have no parent/child structure), this setting has no visible effect.

*(For example, if Hierarchical is Yes and you're listing Categories, sub-categories will be indented under their parent categories.)*

## Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
    **Category List in Sidebar:** Add the Terms widget to your sidebar and select **Categories** with _Display as Dropdown_ = **No**. This will show a simple list of all listing categories. Users can click a category (e.g., "Restaurant") to view all listings in that category.
  </Card>
  <Card>
    **Locations Dropdown in Footer:** Place a Terms widget in your footer and set it to **Locations** with _Display as Dropdown_ = **Yes**. The footer will then have a compact dropdown list of locations. A visitor can pick a location from the dropdown and be taken to that location's listing archive.
