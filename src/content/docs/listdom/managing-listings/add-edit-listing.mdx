## Introduction
List items simply with Listdom. Now, it’s time to create a listing. Creating a listing with the Listdom WordPress plugin is straightforward.

The listings (also known as directories) are the main part of Listdom. A listing can be a job position, a house ad, a service provider, etc. To add a new listing (directory) in Listdom just go to **Listings → Add Listing**.  
There are several sections on this page and we will investigate them individually.

---

## 1. Add Title
Enter a name for this listing.

## 2. Listing Description
The description of this listing. A description can include any information about the listing that the users will need.

## 3. Locations
The locations are useful for categorizing listings according to different regions.  

There are two ways to make a new location and use it for this listing:  
- You can use the **Listdom Location taxonomy menu** to configure more details of the location. This way the made location will appear on this list and you can use it. (Reload the page to see new locations in the list.)  
- Or make the location directly on this page. Hit **+Add New Location**, enter a name, and select the parent location. Parent Location is useful for hierarchical relationships (e.g., Country → City → Zone). Finally, press **Add New Location** and it will be created and marked as selected.  

A listing can have several locations. Select them from the **All Locations** list or use the **Most Used** tab to find them quickly.

## 4. Tags
A tag is a useful taxonomy for grouping the listings with the same options (e.g., 24/7). Tags appear on the single listing page and in some listing card styles.  

Add new tags by typing and pressing Enter, or choose existing tags. You can also add multiple tags at once separated by commas.

## 5. Features
Features specify specific capabilities of a listing (e.g., Free Wifi, Parking Lot). Adding features works the same way as tags.

## 6. Labels
Labels highlight a listing by showing a special badge (e.g., “Recommended”). Labels can be created directly or via the **Labels menu**.

## 7. Featured Image
Select a featured image for this listing. It will be shown on both the single listing page and listing cards.

## 8. Categories
The categories are the main taxonomy of Listdom listings. Each listing must have a primary category, but you can also assign additional categories.

👉 The **Additional Categories** feature comes from the **Listdom Multiple Categories Add-on**.

## 9. Price Options
Define the price for each listing. Options include:
- **Currency**
- **Price**
- **Price (Max)**
- **Price Description** (e.g., “per night”)
- **Price Class** ($, $$, $$$, $$$$)

## 10. Work Hours
Specify work hours and off days for each day (e.g., 9 AM – 9 PM). Marking a day as “off” means the listing does not work on that day.

## 11. Contact Details
Add information like email, phone, and social networks. These appear in the “Contact Info” section of the listing and cards.

## 12. Listing Link
Enter a custom link (e.g., affiliate URL). Activate this option in settings.

## 13. Remark
Owner message displayed on the single listing page.

## 14. Gallery
Add multiple images as a slider/gallery on the single listing page or carousel on cards.

## 15. Embed
Add embed codes (e.g., YouTube videos). Mark one embed as **Featured Video**.

👉 This feature is available in the **Listdom Pro Add-on**.

Remember: Always assign a category before publishing. Without it, the listing won’t display correctly.
