Adding a new listing (or editing an existing one) in Listdom is done through the Add/Edit Listing screen in the WordPress dashboard. This interface lets you enter all the details for a listing, from basic title and description to categories, location on the map, pricing, contact info, and more. This page will walk you through each option available on the Add/Edit Listing page, including standard fields and those enabled by Listdom addons.

## Title and Description

When creating or editing a listing, start with the basic Title and Description fields. These are the standard WordPress post title and editor for the listing content. Use the title to name the listing (e.g. the property name or business name), and the description for full details about the listing. The description field supports the rich text editor so you can format text, add media, etc. If Excerpt support is enabled, you will also have a Short Description field (Excerpt) to provide a brief summary of the listing. This short description may be used in listing cards or previews.

If you have the Listdom AI Assistant enabled, you might see a Generate button near the editor. This can help automatically create content for your listing description using AI.

## Categories and Taxonomies

Listdom organizes listings with several taxonomy options: Categories, Locations, Labels, Tags, and Features. These help classify and filter listings.

- **Listing Category**: Every listing must belong to one category (e.g. Restaurants, Real Estate, Events). On the Add Listing screen, choose a category from the available list. Categories are hierarchical, so you can select sub-categories if applicable. By default, only one category can be assigned as the primary category for a listing.
  <Aside type="note">By default a listing can have one category. With the Multiple Categories add-on installed, you can assign multiple categories to a single listing.</Aside>
  The selected category is required and will be saved as the listing's primary category.
- **Listing Location**: If your listings are organized by location (e.g. city or region), you can assign one or more Locations to the listing. Locations are a taxonomy (hierarchical) that you can manage (e.g. New York, California). On the Add Listing page, use the Locations meta box to check or select the appropriate location terms. This is optional; you can leave it blank if the listing is not location-specific.
- **Listing Labels**: Labels are taxonomy terms used to tag listings with special labels or statuses. For example, you might have labels like Featured, New, Open Now, etc. You can assign any number of labels to the listing. Labels are optional-if your site uses them, you'll see a Labels meta box where you can choose existing labels or add new ones.
- **Listing Tags**: Tags are another way to add keywords to a listing. Tags in Listdom work like post tags they are free-form keywords. You can enter multiple tags separated by commas (for example: Italian, Pizza, Live Music for a restaurant listing). Tags are optional and mainly used for search filtering or grouping similar listings.
- **Listing Features**: Features represent specific amenities or attributes of the listing (for example, Free Wi-Fi, Parking Available, Pet Friendly). Features are a taxonomy (non-hierarchical or hierarchical depending on setup) where you can check off all applicable features for the listing. In the Add Listing form, you'll find a Features meta box listing all predefined features - simply tick the ones that apply. These will show on the listing page as a list of amenities.

Each of these taxonomy options helps users filter and find listings on the front-end. All taxonomy meta boxes are usually shown in the right sidebar of the Add/Edit Listing screen by default (similar to how WordPress shows Categories and Tags for blog posts).

## Custom Fields (Listing Information)

If you have defined custom listing fields, those will appear in the Listing Information section when adding a listing. Custom fields are extra fields (such as text, number, select, checkbox, etc.) that capture additional information not covered by the default fields. For example, if you run a real estate directory, you might add custom fields for Bedrooms, Bathrooms, or Square Footage. Each custom attribute will be shown with its field input here.

- **Custom Fields**: These will display as input fields labeled by the attribute name. Fill in each attribute as needed. Some custom fields might allow multiple selections or file uploads depending on their type. For instance, an attribute defined as an image field will let you upload an image for that listing, and a multi-select attribute will let you choose multiple options.

- **Required Custom Fields**: Administrators can configure certain fields as required. Required fields are indicated with a red asterisk (*). You must provide values for any required attribute before you can publish the listing.

## Location

The Location meta box lets you specify the listing's geographic location and how it's shown on the map.

- **Address**: Enter the address or general location of the listing. This is a text field (e.g. street address, city, or any descriptive location). It's used for display and for geocoding the map location.
- **Map and Coordinates**: Below the address field, you'll see an interactive map. You can place a marker on the map to pinpoint the exact location of the listing. By default, a Marker is used to represent the listing's location. As you move the marker or enter an address, the Latitude and Longitude coordinates will be automatically set (you typically won't need to manually enter lat/long, but they are stored for precision). You can also adjust the map zoom level if needed.
- **Marker vs. Shape**: Listdom allows two modes for location display:
  - **Marker**: A single point location (default). Use this for most listings - simply drop the marker at the listing's location.
  - **Shape**: An area on the map. If you select Shape, you can draw a shape (such as a circle or polygon) on the map to cover a region. When Shape is selected, additional options appear:
    - **Shape Type**: Choose the type of shape (for example, a circle or polygon).
    - **Shape Coordinates/Radius**: Define the shape. For a circle, you set the center (by dragging on the map) and a radius. For a polygon, you can draw the polygon by clicking on the map to set vertices. The coordinates or radius are saved for that shape. Switching back to Marker will remove any drawn shape and use a single pin.
- **Map Center & Zoom**: The map may show Map Center Latitude and Longitude fields (usually pre-filled with default values). These fields control the initial center point of the map in the admin (they default to values set in Listdom settings). Generally, you won't edit these for individual listings; they're just for reference. The Zoom Level is typically handled automatically, but you can adjust it if needed (to zoom in closer or out).

<Aside type="caution">
Listdom supports both Google Maps and OpenStreetMap for the map display. If you wish to use Google Maps, make sure you have entered a Google Maps API Key in the Listdom Settings before adding listings. Otherwise, the map may not load Google data. If no Google API key is provided, Listdom will default to OpenStreetMap for mapping.

## Details

This meta box contains several groups of fields for pricing, contact info, and other details.

- **Price Class**: An indicator of how expensive the listing is, typically shown as dollar signs. The options are:
    - `$` (Cheap)
    - `$$` (Normal)
    - `$$$` (High)

- **Multiple Embeds**: You can add multiple embed entries for several media items, like a video tour and a 360° panorama.
- **Featured Video**: You can mark one embed item as "featured," which may cause it to replace the featured image or appear prominently at the top of the listing.

- **Enable Booking**: Mark the listing as a bookable item.
- **Bookables (Items/Tickets)**: Add one or more bookable items, each with a title, price, and description (e.g., "Double Room", "VIP Tour Package").
