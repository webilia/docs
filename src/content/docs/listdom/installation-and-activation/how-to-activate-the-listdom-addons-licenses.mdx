Activating the **Listdom WordPress classification plugin** on your WordPress website is very simple, and with just a few clicks you can start publishing listings and directories on your site.

## Get the License Key
The **Listdom plugin is free**, so you won't need to activate a license for it.  
The paid add-ons and themes have a **14-day trial** before activation. You need to activate them to continue using them.  

To get your licenses:  
<Steps>
1. Navigate to your **Listdom account â†’ Licenses tab**.  
2. Copy the license code of the product you want to activate.  
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
Always copy the license key exactly as it is shown in your Listdom account to avoid activation errors.

## Enter the License Key
<Steps>
1. First, make sure you have the **latest version** of each add-on installed on your site. You can download them from **Listdom account â†’ Downloads**.  
2. Go to your site's backend and navigate to **Listdom â†’ Licenses**.  
3. Enter the license key you got from your Listdom account.  
4. Click on the **Activate** button.  
</Steps>

If your code is valid, the product will be activated successfully. ðŸŽ‰

## How to Deactivate a License
To use the Webilia products on a new site, you need to deactivate the license on the old site.  
There are **two ways** to deactivate a license:

### From Your Listdom account
<Steps>
1. Navigate to your **Listdom account â†’ Licenses tab**.  
2. Under each license, click on **Manage Sites**.  
3. You will see the list of activated sites.  
4. Click on **Deactivate Site** to disable the license.  
</Steps>

### From Your Site
<Steps>
1. On your site, go to **Listdom â†’ Licenses tab**.  
2. Find the product you want to deactivate.  
3. In the deactivation field, type **deactivate**.  
4. Press the **Deactivate** button.  
5. (Optional) Click on **Manage Your Licenses** to log in to your Listdom account.  
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
If you forget to deactivate a license before moving to a new site, the old activation will still count toward your license limit.
