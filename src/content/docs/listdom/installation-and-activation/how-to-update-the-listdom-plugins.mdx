Keeping your Listdom plugin and add-ons up to date ensures you always have the latest features, security patches, and compatibility improvements. You can update Listdom in two ways: **manually** or **automatically**.

## The Manual Way

The process of manual updating is the same as installing the plugins. You should download the latest version of Listdom from the WordPress plugins repository. Also, the add-ons' latest versions are available in your **Listdom account**. Finally, you should upload the downloaded files to your site.  

<Steps>
1. **Upload via FTP**  
   - Unzip the `.zip` file that you've downloaded.  
   - Upload the extracted folder into `/wp-content/plugins/`.  
   - In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins → Installed Plugins** and activate the updated plugin.  

2. **Upload in WordPress Dashboard**  
   - Navigate to **Plugins → Installed Plugins**.  
   - Click the **Add New** button and then hit **Upload Plugin**.  
   - Choose the downloaded `.zip` file and click **Install Now**.  
   - Confirm the replacement and hit the **Replace current with uploaded** button to update and activate the new version.  
</Steps>

## The Automatic Way

To access automatic updates, first make sure the Listdom add-ons are activated with a valid license key on your site. The process of activating is explained in the [License Activation guide](/listdom/installation-and-activation/how-to-activate-the-listdom-addons-licenses/).  

Then, under the **Dashboard** menu in the WordPress admin panel, go to **Updates** to see the available updates of all plugins and themes. If there is a new update for Listdom and its add-ons or themes, select them and click **Update Plugins** or **Update Themes**.

If you don't see new updates, it could be due to caching or server-related issues. Click on the **Check Again** button in the Updates screen to refresh the update status directly from Listdom's servers.
