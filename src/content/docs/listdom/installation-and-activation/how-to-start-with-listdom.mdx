After downloading the Listdom from the WordPress repository, it’s time to start your amazing journey of creating a valuable directory website. Here we will review the main steps to create the first listings and then show them on the site. A complete step-by-step process of setting up the Listdom listing plugin and getting access to its many powerful features in the best way.

You might also import the Listdom dummy data. In this situation, there are some existing listings and taxonomies on your site. This guide helps you to understand what’s there and where to start.

## Steps overview

<Steps>
1. **Installation and activation of Listdom:** Listdom is a WordPress plugin. So first you need to install it on your site.
2. **Add-ons installation:** Listdom add-ons can add extra features to the Listdom main plugin.
3. **Settings:** Like any other new plugin on your site, after installation, you have to configure it.
4. **First listing creation:** It’s time to create the first listing based on your website niche and purpose.
5. **Configuration of the listing taxonomies:** A listing page, also called a directory page, is the main part of the plugin. Each item on your directory site like jobs, hotels, ads, cars, homes, etc. is a listing. The listings can be gathered in different groups with the same taxonomy. Categories, Labels, and Tags are some of them. Also, they can have some custom fields (attributes) too..
6. **Skin choosing and shortcode creation:** You can show a list of the listings in different styles and skins on any of your site pages. To do that you have to create shortcodes. Each shortcode can be inserted in site pages with various methods.
7. **Setting up search and filter forms:** The list of the directories (listings) can have a search or filter form on top or any other position.
8. **Setting up frontend dashboard:** Listdom helps you to have a dashboard page that enables your site users to submit listings without entering the WordPress admin space.
</Steps>

This article works as your roadmap. We will review the steps. Each of them has detailed documentation and there will be a link to that where needed. Let’s start step by step:

## Installation and activation of Listdom

The first step to start using Listdom is to install and activate the plugin. You can download the Listdom from the WordPress repository. For more detailed information, you can read the full guide on how to install and activate the Listdom.

## Add-ons installation

Several add-ons add incredible features to the Listdom. The most used addon is **Listdom Pro Addon**.

## Overall Settings

Before publishing your first listing, there are some settings that you must pay attention to. The settings consist of several topics including Google Recaptcha, maps settings, colors, fonts, etc. The settings are not required to use Listdom. But you need them to add extra functionalities to your site. For example, to use Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, you need to get an API from them. To increase the security of your site, the Google Recaptcha Site and Security keys are required. The details of each part can be achieved through Listdom settings documentation.

<Aside type="caution" title="API keys & security">
Remember to obtain and add your **map provider API** and **Google reCAPTCHA keys** where needed.

## First listings creation

Now it’s time to create your first listing. As it was said, a listing is the main item of your directory site. Everything starts from entering a name and continues with various options to modify its appearance and functions. If you’re looking for a starting point, read the Listdom listing creation guide. Also, you may want to bulk import your pre-made listings. In this case, you can use the Listdom Import / Export feature.

## Configuration of the listing taxonomies

The listings taxonomies play a main role on your directory site. You can create different categories, labels, tags, and locations, and assign them to desired listings. For example, you can create a location named **New York**. Then you can choose it on the desired listings setting to be their default location. The Listdom taxonomies guide can be helpful here.

## Skin choosing and shortcode creation

After publishing the listings, it’s time to show a list of them on your site. You can show your listings in different skins and views including **List view, Grid view, Half Map view, Table view**, and many more. With some settings applied, Listdom has over **80 ready views** that can be used with any WordPress theme.

Listdom has a powerful shortcode builder that generates specific shortcodes with desired settings. Based on the page builder or editor you use like WordPress Classic Editor, Block Editor, Elementor, etc. you can insert the shortcodes with different methods in your site. Mostly it’s possible to paste the shortcode term directly in a text area or use a Shortcode widget/module. Get to know the Listdom Shortcode Builder more.
