Listdom has a powerful notification manager that allows you to create different email and SMS templates for different situations. For example, an email for each time a new listing is made or when an application is approved.

## How To Create a Notification

To begin with, Navigate to Listdom → Notifications.

This page has a table of the pre-made templates you can use. Each table row includes the notification template’s Title, SMS state, and Hook.

**Title:** Name of the Notification.
**SMS:** Enabled if an SMS is sent with the email.
<Aside type="note">
The SMS notifications are available in the Listdom SMS Add-on.
</Aside>

**Hook:** The event in which the email and SMS are sent.
If you don’t see some of the columns, click on the “Screen Options” on the top right of the screen and mark the needed column names to display them. To edit and use a template, click on its title. Also, you can use the options under the title to Edit, Quick Edit, Trash, or Duplicate the template.

To create your template from scratch, hit the “Add Notification” button.

<Steps>
1. **Add Title**  
The name of this notification. The notification title will be used as the email subject too.

2. **Content**  
The content of the notification email. It includes:

**Hook:** A hook is an event that happens in the website system. When something happens in the system, a hook is called. For example, a hook can be called when a new listing is created, when a new booking is made, or when a claim is paid. You can create an email or SMS notification for each hook. For example, you can create a notification to send an email when a new listing is created. It’s important to assign the notification to the correct hook; Otherwise, it won’t work as expected. Several Hooks are available to choose from. Some of them are available in the Listdom free version and the others are added by installing different add-ons of the Listdom.

**Content Text Area:** This is a WYSIWYG editor to make the email content. Shortcodes and HTML codes are allowed in the content.

3. **Placeholders**  
Placeholders are dynamic data that can be added to the email and SMS content. Different Placeholders are available based on the Hook selected. For example, the name of the person who sends the contact request by the contact form. Use the #placeholders# in the notification content and subject (title). Change the Hook to see each one’s specific placeholders.

| --- | --- |
| Contact Owner | Listing Owner |

BCC is best for keeping addresses private on mail lists. while a CC recipient can see a list of the recipients who have received this email, the BCC recipient does not.

5. **SMS**  
By enabling the SMS status, an SMS with the desired content will be sent anytime the event occurs. HTML codes and shortcodes are not allowed in the SMS content but you can use the placeholders.

To learn more about the SMS settings, read the Listdom SMS Add-on documentation.

The SMS notifications are available in the Listdom SMS Add-on.

6. **Publish**  
It’s the final option you must get to. After finishing all of the configurations of the notification, click on the publish button to be able to use the shortcode. Other options in this section are:

- **Save draft:** Before publishing the notification, you can save it as a draft and get back to it later.
- **Status:** choose the status of the shortcode to be Published (available after the shortcode is published.), Draft, and Pending Review. If you want to disable a notification, you can change its status.
- **Visibility:** Select the visibility condition. Available options are:
  - **Public:** The default, viewable to all.
  - **Password protected:** Clicking this radio button followed by “OK” causes a further text box to appear, into which you can enter a password.
  - **Private:** This option hides the content from the public completely.
- **Published on / Published immediately:** Select the publish date and time.
