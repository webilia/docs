Both **Vertex Addons Lite** (the free version) and **Vertex Addons Pro** expand what you can do with Elementor. The free plugin already includes dozens of widgets and extensions. The **Pro** upgrade adds exclusive widgets and advanced features.

## Pro-Exclusive Widgets 
- **EDD Tabs Widget** – Integrates Easy Digital Downloads content into tabbed layouts. (Lite users will see this widget marked as Pro/locked.)

## Advanced Tools & Capabilities in Pro <Badge text="Pro" variant="success" />
- **Multi-Step Forms** – Break long forms into multiple steps.  
- **reCAPTCHA v3 Integration** – Built-in spam protection for forms.  
- **File Upload Enhancements** – Multiple file uploads, restrictions, and size limits.  
- **Login/Register Popups and Dropdowns** – Extra skins for modal popups or dropdown menus.  
- **Additional Widget Options** – Enhanced controls for widgets like Off-Canvas Menu and Sticky.  
- **Premium Template Kits** – Extra templates and blocks for Pro users.
