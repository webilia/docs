The **Media & Interactivity** category of Vertex Addons offers widgets that make your content more dynamic and engaging. These widgets go beyond static text and images, allowing you to add interactive graphics, audio, and animations to your pages. Use them to capture attention and provide richer user experiences.

This category includes the following widgets:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard href="./image-hotspot" title="Image Hotspot" description="Overlay interactive hotspots on an image with tooltips. Great for product feature highlights or interactive infographics." />
  <LinkCard href="./sound-player" title="Sound Player" description="Embed an audio player with play/pause, track seek, and volume controls. Ideal for music, podcasts, or any audio content." />
  <LinkCard href="./lottie" title="Lottie Animation" description="Add lightweight, scalable animations (Lottie files) to your page. Animations play automatically and can loop, enhancing visual appeal." />
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="note" title="When to Use Media & Interactivity Widgets">
Use these widgets whenever you want to make a page more engaging and interactive:
- **Image Hotspot** is perfect for highlighting parts of an image (e.g. product details on a photo or points on a map) with clickable markers and explanatory tooltips.
- **Sound Player** lets visitors play audio without leaving the page - great for embedding music tracks, audio guides, or podcasts.
- **Lottie** brings in eye-catching animations (like illustrations that move) while keeping file sizes small, which is great for drawing attention to key sections or adding some flare to your design.
By incorporating media and interactive elements, you can **increase user engagement** and convey information in ways that text alone can't.
