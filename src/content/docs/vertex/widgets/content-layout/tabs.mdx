The **Tabs** widget lets you organize content into tabbed sections. Users can switch between different content panels by clicking the tab labels. This is useful to present related information in a compact space (for example, product specs vs. reviews, or multiple categories of content) without cluttering the page with all content at once.

## How to Use the Tabs Widget

<Steps>

1. **Add the Tabs widget:** Drag the **Tabs** widget into your page in the Elementor editor.
2. **Create Tabs:** In the content settings, you'll see Tab Items. By default there may be a couple of sample tabs. You can **Add Item** to create a new tab. For each tab item:
   - Enter the **Title** of the tab (this appears on the tab button).
   - Enter the **Content** for that tab. You can type text, or even include other widgets/formatting in the rich text editor for more complex content.
3. **Tab Position (Layout):** Decide how the tabs should be positioned. By default, tabs are horizontal (the tab labels appear at the top). You can change the **Position** setting to **Left** to display tabs vertically on the left side of the content. (Horizontal tabs along the top is the "Top" position.)
4. **Additional Options:** The Tabs widget may include options for behavior:
   - You can choose which tab is **Default Active** (usually the first tab is open initially).
   - Some tab widgets allow switching tabs on hover versus click. By default, Vertex Tabs switch on click (which is standard).
5. **Style the Tabs:** Go to the **Style** tab to customize:
   - **Tabs (Nav) Style:** Adjust the typography and color of the tab labels. You can set **Normal** and **Active** state colors (for example, make the active tab label highlighted with a different color or underline).
   - **Content Style:** Style the content area (padding, background color, text styles for the content).
   - **Border/Divider:** If the design uses dividers between tabs or an outline, you can adjust those colors and widths.
6. **Responsive Considerations:** When viewing on mobile, horizontal tabs might stack or turn into an accordion-style for usability. Check the responsive preview in Elementor and adjust alignment or font size so tab labels remain readable on smaller screens.
7. **Save and Test:** Publish or preview the page. Click between your tab labels to ensure each content panel appears correctly and the styling matches your design.

Use the Tabs widget to avoid long scrolling pages. For example, on a product page, you could have "Description", "Specifications", and "Reviews" each in their own tab. This keeps the page tidy and lets users quickly navigate to the content they care about.

<Aside type='note'>
If you have many tabs or very long tab labels, consider using a vertical layout so that the labels are listed down the side. Vertical tabs (by setting Position to Left) provide more room for long titles. Horizontal tabs work best for a small number of short labels.
