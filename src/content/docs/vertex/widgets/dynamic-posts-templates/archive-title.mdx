The **Archive Title** widget dynamically displays the title of the current archive page. This is useful in templates for blog archives, category/tag listings, author archives, date archives, or search results pages. By default, the Archive Title includes a context prefix (e.g. "Category:", "Tag:", "Author:") to clarify the type of archive being viewed, followed by the archive's name or term.

<Aside type="note">
The Archive Title widget is typically used **only within Archive Templates** in Elementor's Theme Builder. For single pages or posts, use the **Page Title Widget** for pages or the **Post Title** widget for posts instead.

## Usage

<Steps>
1. In WordPress, navigate to **Templates â†’ Theme Builder** and create or edit an **Archive** template (for example, a blog posts archive or category archive template).
2. Inside the Elementor editor for the archive template, find **Archive Title** in the widgets panel (usually under *Theme Elements* or *Archive* widgets).
3. Drag and drop the **Archive Title** widget onto your archive template, typically at the top of the page where an archive heading should appear.
4. Choose the appropriate HTML tag for the title (e.g. **H1** for main page title, or **H2/H3** if there is another page title present). You can set this under the widget's **HTML Tag** option.
5. Customize the alignment, typography, and style under the **Style** tab to match your design.

## Features and Options

- **Dynamic Archive Detection:** The widget automatically detects the type of archive and displays the relevant title. For example, on a category archive it will show *Category: [Category Name]*, on a tag archive *Tag: [Tag Name]*, on an author page *Author: [Author's Name]*, on a date archive *Month: [Month Year]* or *Year: [Year]*, and on search results *Search Results for: [Query]*.
- **Context Prefix:** By default, Archive Title prepends a context label like "Category:" or "Author:" to the title for clarity. If you prefer to display only the name without the prefix, you can disable the context. To do this, click the dynamic tags icon next to the title field in the widget (which shows that the content is dynamic), then toggle **Include Context** off. This will remove the prefix and show just the archive name.
- **HTML Tag:** The Archive Title text can be output as any heading level or HTML tag. By default it may use an `<h2>` tag. You can change the **HTML Tag** option (e.g., to H1 for the main archive heading) to ensure proper hierarchy and SEO for your page.
- **Linking:** This widget is purely a text heading and does not inherently link anywhere. (It wouldn't make sense to link an archive title, since it is the current page title.) The **Link** option is not applicable for Archive Title, keeping it simple and static.

<Aside type="tip" title='Design Tip'>
Use the Archive Title widget in conjunction with other archive elements (like breadcrumb, Archive Description, etc.) to provide context to visitors. For example, a category archive can include the Archive Title followed by a brief category description for better UX.

## Styling

The Archive Title can be styled via the **Style** tab like a typical heading:
- **Text Color:** Choose the color of the title text.
- **Typography:** Set the font, size, weight, transform, and other typography options for the title.
- **Alignment:** Align the title left, center, or right within its container.
- **Text Shadow and Stroke:** If your design calls for it, you can add a text shadow or stroke effect to the title text.
- **Spacing:** Adjust margin/padding around the title to position it nicely in your design.

These styling options let you match the Archive Title's appearance to your theme. For instance, you might center an author archive title and use a larger font, or left-align a category title with specific branding colors.

<Aside type="note">
By default, the Archive Title text adopts global typography settings for headings (if set in Elementor Site Settings) unless overridden. It's a good idea to keep archive titles consistent (e.g., all archive page titles use the same styling for uniformity across the site).
</Aside>

## Example

To illustrate, if you use the Archive Title widget on a **Travel** category archive, it might display **"Category: Travel"** as the heading. If you disable *Include Context*, it would simply show **"Travel"**. On an **Author** archive for an author named Jane Doe, it would display **"Author: Jane Doe"**, and a **Search** results page for "London" would show **"Search Results for: London"**.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Category Archive">
    On a "Photography" category page, the widget shows: **Category: Photography**
  </Card>
  <Card title="Author Archive">
    On an author page for John Smith, it shows: **Author: John Smith**
  </Card>
  <Card title="Search Results">
    On a search results page for "Elementor", it shows: **Search Results for: Elementor**
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Using the Archive Title widget ensures your archive pages have a clear, dynamic title that automatically updates based on the content being viewed, without needing manual changes. This makes it an essential element for any archive template in your Vertex-powered Elementor site.
