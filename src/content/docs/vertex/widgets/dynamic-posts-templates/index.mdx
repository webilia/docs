**Dynamic Posts & Templates Widgets**  
Vertex Addons for Elementor provides a set of **Dynamic Posts & Templates** widgets that help you create custom blog layouts, post templates, and archive pages with ease. These widgets dynamically pull content from your posts and pages, allowing you to design templates that automatically update with your content. Whether you want to display a post's title, featured image, metadata, or even an entire list of posts, these widgets give you the flexibility to build it visually in Elementor.

<Aside type="note" title="What Are Dynamic Widgets?">
“Dynamic” widgets fetch content from your WordPress site automatically (e.g., the current post's data). This means you can design one template and use it for many posts or archives without manually updating the content each time.
