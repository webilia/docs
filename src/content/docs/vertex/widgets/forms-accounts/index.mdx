The **Forms & Accounts** category of Vertex Addons empowers you to create interactive forms and user account interfaces directly within Elementor. With these widgets, you can build contact forms, registration/login forms, and more - all without any coding.

<Aside type="note" title="Why Forms Matter">
Using Vertex's form widgets means you don't need extra plugins for contact forms or login pages. Everything is handled inside Elementor, keeping your site lightweight and integrated.

## Widgets in Forms & Accounts

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard href="./form-builder/" title="Form Builder" description="Build custom forms with various field types, validations, and submission actions." />
  <LinkCard href="./login-register/" title="Login & Register" description="Create user login, registration, and password reset forms with ease." />
</CardGrid>

Both widgets are designed to be **user-friendly and highly customizable**. You can style the forms to match your site, set up custom messages, and ensure everything is responsive on all devices.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title='Form Builder'>

  </Card>
  <Card title='Login & Register'>
  A convenient widget to place user authentication forms on your site. It handles user login, new user registration, and password recovery, integrating with WordPress user accounts.

<Aside type="tip" title="Getting Started">
To begin, ensure you have **Vertex Addons for Elementor** activated. The Forms & Accounts widgets will appear in the Elementor editor under the "Vertex" or similar category. Simply drag the widget onto your page to start configuring it.
