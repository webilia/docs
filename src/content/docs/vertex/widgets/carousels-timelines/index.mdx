## Widgets in Carousels & Timelines

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard href="./testimonial-carousel/" title="Testimonial Carousel" description="Show client testimonials in a sliding carousel format." />
  <LinkCard href="./team-member-carousel/" title="Team Member Carousel" description="Display your team or staff profiles in an interactive carousel." />
  <LinkCard href="./timeline/" title="Timeline" description="Present events or milestones on a vertical timeline." />
  <LinkCard href="./news-ticker/" title="News Ticker" description="Show scrolling news headlines or post titles on your site." />
  <LinkCard href="./countdown/" title="Countdown" description="Add a countdown timer counting down to a specific date or time." />
</CardGrid>

These widgets are **highly customizable** and optimized for performance:
- **Testimonial Carousel:** Rotate through testimonials or quotes, with options for star ratings and multiple slides visible.
- **Team Member Carousel:** Showcase team members or client logos in a sliding gallery, complete with images and social links.
- **Timeline:** Display a list of events or steps in chronological order, using an elegant vertical timeline with icons and dates.
- **News Ticker:** Create a horizontal scrolling feed of recent posts or announcements, much like a news headline ticker.
- **Countdown:** Build excitement by counting down to a launch, event, or deadline with a live timer.

All carousel widgets (Testimonial & Team Member) use a lightweight slider system for smooth animations and offer responsive controls - you can set how many items show at once on desktop, tablet, and mobile. The timeline and ticker provide eye-catching ways to present information that updates or progresses.

<Aside type="tip" title="Common Settings">
Carousels share common settings like **Slides to Show**, **Autoplay**, **Navigation Arrows**, and **Pagination Dots**. Once you learn one, you can easily configure the others. Similarly, all items can be styled (colors, typography, spacing) under the Style tab to match your site.
