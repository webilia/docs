The **Team Member Carousel** widget lets you display a set of team profiles (or any collection of images and text) in a sliding carousel. It's great for introducing your team, showcasing client logos, or any group of items you want to highlight in a rotating gallery.

## Setting Up Team Members

After adding the Team Member Carousel widget to your page, you can add team profiles as items:

<Steps>

1. **Add Team Members:** In the **Content** tab, under the **Team Member Carousel** section, click **Add Item** to create a new member entry. Repeat this for each team member or item you want to showcase.
2. **Configure Each Profile:** Each item includes:
   - **Image:** The member's photo or image (choose an image for the person's headshot or a representative graphic).
   - **Title:** The name of the team member. (This is usually the person's full name.)
   - **Description:** A brief description, such as the person's role/position (e.g., "Lead Developer") or a short bio snippet.
   - **Social Icons:** You can add up to three social or contact icons for each member (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter, Email). By default, *Social Icons* are enabled. For each icon:
     - Choose an icon (the widget offers a library of popular brand icons and generic icons - you'll see options for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).
     - Provide a URL for that icon (for example, the team member's LinkedIn profile link). If you leave the URL blank, the icon won't be clickable.
     - You can typically configure 3 separate icons (Icon 1, Icon 2, Icon 3). If you need fewer, simply remove the extra ones or disable the Social Icons toggle entirely.
3. **Reordering:** Drag and drop the items in the list if you want to change the order the team members appear in the carousel.

</Steps>

Keep descriptions concise - usually a job title or a one-sentence bio works well. Too much text can make the carousel slides tall and inconsistent.

## Carousel Behavior Settings

Under the **Settings** section of Content, you can adjust how the carousel functions:

- **Slides on Display:** Set how many profiles are visible at once. For example, display **3** team members in a row on desktop for a gallery feel, and perhaps fewer on mobile (you can set responsive values for tablet and phone).
- **Slides on Scroll:** Determine how many slides move when advancing. Commonly this is **1**, so the carousel shifts one member at a time.
- **Pagination:** Choose **Dots** to show indicator dots (useful if you have several members, as it hints at how many sets there are) or select **None** if you prefer a cleaner look without dots.
- **Autoplay:** Toggle this **On (yes)** to have the carousel auto-rotate through members. You can then set **Autoplay Speed** (in milliseconds, e.g., 2000ms = 2 seconds) to control how fast it advances.
- **Pause on Hover:** If autoplay is on, enable **Pause on Hover** so that when a visitor hovers their mouse over the carousel, it pauses the sliding (helpful so they can read details without the slider moving).
- **Infinite Scroll:** Keep this on **Yes** for a continuous loop (recommended for a nice seamless carousel). If turned off, the slider will stop when it reaches the last member and not loop back.

These options help ensure visitors see all team members without manual intervention (if autoplay is on), or allow them to manually browse if they prefer.

## Navigation Options

Under **Navigation**, you have similar arrow controls as the Testimonial Carousel:

- **Arrows:** Enable this to show Previous/Next arrow buttons.
- Customize arrow **Icons** (you can change from the default arrows if desired).
- **Arrow Position:** Adjust offsets to position the arrows. For example, you might want arrows to overlay on the carousel images or sit just outside the carousel container. Use the **Offset Left/Top** sliders to nudge their placement.
- When styling, ensure arrows are visible against your images (choose a contrasting color or add a background circle to the arrow icons via Style settings).

## Styling the Carousel

Use the **Style** tab to refine the appearance:

- **Image Style:** Control the width/size of member photos and their shape. For instance, set a uniform size so all headshots align, and apply a border radius to make them circular if they aren't already perfect circles.
- **Spacing:** Adjust margin or padding around images and text. You might add space below each photo before the name, or between the name and description.
- **Typography:** Set the font, size, and color for the **Name (Title)** and the **Description**. Perhaps make the name bold and slightly larger, with the role in a lighter color.
- **Alignment:** You can center all content within each slide, or align left/right depending on your design.
- **Social Icon Style:** Style the icons (color and size). For example, you might color them with your brand color or the platform's signature color. Also, you can adjust spacing between icons.
- **Slide Background/Borders:** Some designs put each member's info in a card with a background. You can add a background color or border to the item container if desired (e.g., a light gray background behind each member's info to separate from the page background).

Remember that, like testimonials, multiple items per slide will shrink to fit; on smaller screens the widget will automatically stack or show fewer per slide (based on your responsive "Slides on Display" settings).

## Use Cases

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title='Meet the Team'>A "Our Team" page section where each slide highlights a different department or a random selection of team members.</Card>
  <Card title='Advisors or Contributors'>If you have a list of collaborators or sponsors, you can use their logos or headshots in a carousel.</Card>
  <Card title='Client Logos'>Even though it's called Team Member Carousel, you could repurpose it to scroll through client logos or partner logos - just use the image for the logo and perhaps the title for the company name. (Social icons could even link to case studies or external sites in this scenario.)</Card>
</CardGrid>

The Team Member Carousel provides an interactive way to humanize your site by showing the faces behind the company. With autoplay and a sleek design, visitors can scroll through and get a sense of your team at a glance.
