Now that Vertex Addons is installed, let's take a quick tour of how it works in both the WordPress dashboard and the Elementor editor.

## In the WordPress Dashboard 
- **Vertex Addons Menu:** A new menu appears in the sidebar.  
- **Widgets & Extensions:** Toggle features on/off for performance.  
- **Pro Features:** Marked with a lock icon if Pro is not active.  
- **Settings & License:** Adjust global options and enter Pro license keys.

## In the Elementor Editor 
- Open a page in Elementor.  
- In the widget sidebar, scroll to **Vertex Addons** and **Vertex Addons Pro** categories.  
- Drag and drop any widget into your layout.  
- Customize the widget in the editor just like Elementor's native widgets.  

**Example:** Enable the **Sticky** extension on a section via the Advanced tab to keep it visible on scroll.
